<p>In the first section of this book, our goal was to set up some of the theoretical ideas that motivate our approach to experimental design and planning. We introduced our key thesis, namely that experiments are about measuring causal effects. We also began to discuss some of our key themes, including precision of measurement, reduction of bias, and generalization across populations. In this next section of the book, treating statistical topics, we will integrate these ideas with an analytic toolkit for <strong>estimation</strong> of causal effects and quantifying the precision of estimates (this chapter), making <strong>inferences</strong> about the evidence for such effects (Chapter <a href="5-inference.html#inference">5</a>), and making models for estimation and inference in more complex settings (Chapter <a href="6-models.html#models">6</a>). Although this book is not a statistics text, we hope that these chapters provide some practical foundations for beginning the statistical analysis of your experimental data.</p>
<div class="case-study">
<p>üî¨ Case study: The Lady Tasting Tea</p>
<p>The birth of modern statistical inference came from a single, epochal act of mansplaining.<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> An important piece of context for the work of Ronald Fisher, Karl Pearson, and other early pioneers of statistical inference is that they were all strong proponents of eugenics. Fisher was the founding Chairman of the Cambridge Eugenics Society. Pearson was perhaps even worse, an avowed Social Darwinist who believed fervently in Eugenic legislation. These views are repugnant.</span> Sir Ronald Fisher was apparently at a party when a lady declared that she could tell the difference between cups when the tea was added to the milk vs.¬†the milk to the tea. Rather than taking her at her word, Fisher devised an experimental and data analysis procedure to test her claim.<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> If you‚Äôre interested in this history, we recommend <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-salsburg2001" role="doc-biblioref">Salsburg</a> (<a href="#ref-salsburg2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>‚Äôs delightful book, ‚ÄúThe Lady Tasting Tea,‚Äù about the origins of modern statistics.</span></p>
<p>The basic schema of the experiment was that the lady would have to judge a set of new cups of tea and sort them into milk-first vs.¬†tea-first sets. Her data would then be analyzed to determine whether her level of correct choice exceeded that expected by chance. While this process now sounds like a quotidian experiment that might be done on a cooking reality show, in fact this is one of those touchstones that feels unremarkable because it literally established the way science was done for the next century.</p>
<p>One important element of the experiment that was unusual was its treatment of design confounds such as pouring order or cup material. Prior experimental practice would have been to try to equate all of the cups as closely as possible, decreasing the influence of confounders. Fisher recognized that this strategy was insufficient and that random assignment was critical for making strong causal inferences about the treatment (milk then tea vs.¬†tea then milk). We discussed the causal power of random assignment in Chapter <a href="1-intro.html#intro">1</a> ‚Äì this experiment is a key touchstone in the popularization of randomized experiments!<label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span> Randomized experiments were not invented by Fisher. Perhaps the earliest example of a (somewhat) randomized experiment was a trial of scurvey treatments in the 1700s <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dunn1997" role="doc-biblioref">Dunn, 1997</a>)</span>. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-peirce1884" role="doc-biblioref">Peirce &amp; Jastrow</a> (<a href="#ref-peirce1884" role="doc-biblioref">1884</a>)</span> also report a strikingly modern use of randomized stimulus presentation (via shuffling cards). Nevertheless, Fisher‚Äôs statistical work popularized randomized experiments throughout the sciences, in part by integrating them with a set of analytic methods.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="estimating-an-effect" class="section level2" number="4.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Estimating an effect</h2>
<p>If experiments are about estimating effects, how do we actually use our experimental data to make these estimates? With apologies to Fisher, for our example we‚Äôll design a slightly more modern version of his experiment using a forced-choice judgment measure. We present participants with 50 cups of tea (in random order, of course). Half are prepared milk-first, half tea-first. Then the participant must give an independent judgment about each by rating the tea on a scale from 0 (horrible) to 10 (perfect).</p>
<p>Our goal will be to estimate the quality of the tea when it is milk-first. More formally, we want to use our <strong>sample</strong> of 50 tea judgments to estimate a <strong>population parameter</strong> that we can‚Äôt directly observe, namely the true perceived quality of all possible milk-first cups. Here we‚Äôre looking at this simple estimation problem rather than the more familiar problem where we have a sample of different people from a population and we want to try and estimate the population parameter. In Chapter <a href="6-models.html#models">6</a> we‚Äôll talk more about modeling variability across experimental participants from a population.</p>
<!-- ^[MM: This example is perhaps a little confusing for showing the sample vs. population parameter because the population here is a bit hard to conceptualize. Also, I worry that readers will be mislead into thinking that it's the subjectivity in tea ratings that causes statistical uncertainty, rather than the finite sample size. An easier example for this chapter might be something like estimating the mean height of students at College X, where it's more clear that there is no subjectivity involved and that the population is the mean height if we were to measure every student at College X rather than just a sample.]  -->
<p>We‚Äôll try to go easy on notation but some amount will make things clearer. We will use <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> (‚Äútheta‚Äù) to denote the parameter we want to estimate (the ‚Äúestimand‚Äù) and <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}\)</span> its sample estimate.<label for="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">4</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">4</span> Statisticians use ‚Äúhats‚Äù like this to denote sample estimates. One way to remember this is that the ‚Äúperson in the hat‚Äù is wearing a hat to dress up as the actual quantity. Feel free to ignore this but it helps us.</span> This is the probability that the lady is correct in her judgment.</p>
<div id="maximum-likelihood-estimation" class="section level3" number="4.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Maximum likelihood estimation</h3>
<p>OK, you are probably saying, if we we want our estimate of the lady‚Äôs tea-sensitivity, shouldn‚Äôt we just take her average accuracy across the 50 cups of tea? The answer is yes, but let‚Äôs unpack that choice for just a moment.</p>
<p>Taking the sample mean as our estimate <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}\)</span> is an example of an estimation approach called <strong>maximum likelihood estimation</strong>. In general terms, maximum likelihood estimation is a two-step process. First, we assume a <strong>model</strong> for how the data were generated. This model is specified in terms of certain population parameters. In our example, the ‚Äúmodel‚Äù is as simple as they come: we just assume the lady has some unknown accuracy such that on each trial she gets the right answer with probability <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">5</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">5</span> In other problems, like multi-variable regression, the model is more complicated, for example involving more than one regression coefficient ‚Äì that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll get to in Chapter <a href="6-models.html#models">6</a>.</span></p>
<p>Second, we try to find the values of the population parameters that make our observed data as likely as possible. For example, if our sample mean is <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta} = .73\)</span>, what underlying value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> would make these data most likely to occur? Well, suppose the underlying parameter were <span class="math inline">\(\theta=.99\)</span>. Then it would be pretty unlikely that our sample mean would be so much smaller. So <span class="math inline">\(\theta=.99\)</span> is a poor guess for the population parameter based on these data. Conversely, if the parameter were <span class="math inline">\(\theta=.5\)</span>, it would pretty unlikely that our sample mean would be so much <em>larger</em>. The value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> that makes these data most likely is just .73 itself: the sample mean! That is why the sample mean in this case is the maximum likelihood estimate.</p>
</div>
<div id="bayesian-estimation" class="section level3" number="4.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Bayesian estimation</h3>
<p>In the case of the lady tasting tea, we don‚Äôt really have strong expectations about what her <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is. Maybe she‚Äôs tea-sensitive, maybe not. But in some cases, we want to bring our prior knowledge to bear. Say she claimed she could guess the state of each cup of tea without even tasting it ‚Äì or maybe even without even seeing it! You‚Äôd probably be skeptical. (We‚Äôll look at a case like this in the next chapter). How would you formalize this skepticism? One way is by putting in place a prior expectation about her sensitivity.</p>
<!-- [Here I would suggest transitioning by saying that what we did above makes sense if the only criterion for what constitutes a good guess is the data themselves. "But what if we had some background knowledge about heights in this college? For example, we have data from the US Census on adult heights, so we'd probably expect college students to be roughly similar.] -->
<!-- [EXISTING TEXT BELOW] -->
<!-- [^1]: You can't get away from measurement and psychometrics! We said we were really interested in the effect of tea ordering on tea perception. But this number that we're estimating is something more like this particular participant's accuracy, and that's not the same thing that we actually wanted. To get from what we're estimating to our effect of interest, we'd need to establish some **linking hypotheses** about how the participant's accuracy can be derived from the participant's perception and the properties of the stimulus. That's perhaps not worth doing in this toy example, but more generally it's a critical part of getting from your measure to your construct of interest! -->
<p>We can do this via <strong>Bayesian estimation</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> ‚Äì our belief about the participant‚Äôs accuracy. We observe some data <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, consisting of the set of correct and incorrect responses in the experiment. Now we can use <strong>Bayes‚Äô rule</strong>, a tool from basic probability theory, to estimate this number.</p>
<p>Bayes‚Äô rule says:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\color{purple}{p(\theta | d)} = \frac{\color{red}{p(d | \theta )} \color{blue}{p(\theta )}}{\color{black}{p(d)}}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Each part of this equation has a name, and it‚Äôs worth becoming familiar with them. The thing we want to compute (<span class="math inline">\(p(\theta |d)\)</span>) is called the <strong>posterior probability</strong> ‚Äì it tell us what we should believe about the participant‚Äôs ability given the data we observed. We then break that down into two terms in the numerator.<label for="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">6</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">6</span> We‚Äôre making the posterior <span style="color: purple;">purple</span> to indicate the combination of likelihood (<span style="color: red;">red</span>) and prior (<span style="color: blue;">blue</span>).</span></p>
<p>The first part of the numerator is <span class="math inline">\(p(d|h)\)</span>, the probability of the data we observed given our hypothesis about the participant‚Äôs ability. This part is called the <strong>likelihood</strong>.<label for="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">7</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">7</span> Speaking informally, ‚Äúlikelihood‚Äù is just a synonym for probability, but this is a technical meaning for the term, which can get a bit confusing.</span> This term tells us about the relationship between our hypothesis and the data we observed ‚Äì so if we think the participant has high ability (say <span class="math inline">\(\theta = .9\)</span>) then the probability of a bunch of low accuracy observations will be fairly low.</p>
<p>The second term in the numerator, <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta )\)</span>, is called the <strong>prior</strong>. This term encodes our beliefs about how likely our participant is to have different levels of ability. Intuitively, if we think that they are very unlikely to have high tea discrimination ability, we should require more evidence to convince us of a particular level of discrimination. In contrast, if we think they are likely to have this ability, we should be easier to convince.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="4-estimation.html#fig:inference-bayes-demo">4.1</a> gives an example of the combination of prior and data.<label for="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">8</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">8</span> The model we use for this example is called a <strong>Beta-Binomial conjugate model</strong> and is a very convenient model for working with count data representing successes and failures.</span> For the sake of this example, we assume that we have run 12 tea discrimination trials and observed 9 successes and 3 failures. The evidence alone ‚Äì with no prior ‚Äì suggests a discrimination estimate of <span class="math inline">\(9/12 = .75\)</span> (the maximum likelihood estimate). When we use a flat prior, we get the same estimate of 0.75.<label for="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">9</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">9</span> In general, Bayesian estimates and maximum likelihood estimates will exactly coincide either under a flat prior or as you get infinite data (<span class="math inline">\(n \to \infty\)</span>). Bayesian estimation is most important when you have strong beliefs and not a lot of data.</span> In contrast, if we go in assuming that discrimination is likely to be absent or weak, we are biased downward in our eventual estimate of 0.69; if we go in assuming good discrimination, we end up biased upwards to 0.78.</p>

<div id="measures-of-effect-size" class="section level2" number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Measures of effect size</h2>
<p>With all our talk about estimation above, we didn‚Äôt say much about what precisely was being estimated. Often, researchers seek out some sort of common standardized way for describing the relationships they observe in the study.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that Mika and Nicholas are interested in examining whether a dog-petting intervention can reduce depression relative to a placebo. They use the same self-report depression measure, but Mika decides to make it a 10-point self-report scale (0 = ‚ÄúI feel blissful‚Äù to 10 = ‚ÄúI feel extremely depressed‚Äù), whereas Nicholas decides to make it a 100-point scale (1 = ‚ÄúI feel blissful‚Äù to 100 = ‚ÄúI feel extremely depressed‚Äù). Observing that the intervention led to a 1-point decrease in Mika‚Äôs scale is quite impressive. But observing a 1-point decrease in Nicholas‚Äô scale? Not so much!</p>
<p>To ensure that we have a common currency, many researchers describe their observations using standardized metrics. A common example of a such a metric is Cohen‚Äôs <em>d</em>, which provides a standardized estimate of the difference between two means. There are many different ways to calculate Cohen‚Äôs <em>d</em> (Lakens, 2013), but there usually some variant of the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d = \frac{M_1- M_2}{SD_1}\]</span></p>
<p>In the above example, <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> could be the depression scores of patients who were assigned to pet dogs, whereas <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> would be the scores of patients who were assigned to a placebo condition. <span class="math inline">\(SD_1\)</span> refers refers to standard deviation of the participants who were randomly assigned to pet dogs. Note: researchers usually seek to pool the standard deviations of <em>both</em> groups, but (for simplicity) we will assume that both groups have the same standard deviation (and thus <span class="math inline">\(SD_1 = SD_2 = SD_{pooled}\)</span>).</p>
<p>Because Mika and Nicholas used different scales, they will nature observe different amount of variability. For example, if all participants indicate that they are between 2-8 on a 10-point scale, this should translate to a range of 20-80 on a 100-point scale. Similarly, a standard deviation of 2 on Mika‚Äôs scale should correspond to a standard deviation of 20 on Nicholas‚Äô scale.</p>
<p>So let‚Äôs compare their results, assuming that participants in the placebo groups have a mean depression score at the center of the scale (5 out of 10; 50 out of 100) and that both Mika and Nicholas observe a 1-point decrease is depression in the dog-petting group.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{d_{Mika}} = \frac{M_1- M_2}{SD_1} = \frac{5- 4}{2} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{d_{Nicholas}} = \frac{M_1- M_2}{SD_1} = \frac{50- 49}{20} = \frac{1}{20} =  .05\]</span></p>
<p>When using Cohen‚Äôs d, a value of .50 is often considered a strong effect, whereas a value of .05 would often be considered negligible (at least in the context of an intervention designed to improve depression).</p>
<p>Of course, there are many different standardized effect sizes that researchers can use. Although we described a common standardized effect size to describe differences in means, there are also standardized effect sizes for describing the amount of variance explained (e.g., Pearson‚Äôs <em>r</em>, R<sup>2</sup>, and <span class="math inline">\(\eta^2\)</span>) or relationships involving categorical variables (e.g., Odds Ratio). For a review, see‚Ä¶ (Any recommendations?)</p>
<div id="pros-and-cons-of-standardization" class="section level3" number="4.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Pros and cons of standardization</h3>
<p>Pro: comparability across studies (e.g., school interventions to improve achievement?). Useful for meta-analysis (e.g., MA of facial feedback, which used a lot of different measures of emotion; infant consonant discrimination (cross method comparison)). Useful for a lot of power analysis software and packages (e.g., GPower and many packages in R).</p>
<p>Con: loss of information about measures and real-world predictions; dependence on baseline variability. Power analysis can only be done via annoying simulations. Not related to any real units. Often not very intuitive (have fun trying to explain what Cohen‚Äôs <em>d</em> is to a very curious non-scientist.<label for="tufte-sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">10</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-10" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">10</span> Fun fact: the Wikipedia article on effect sizes has been flagged as ‚Äútoo technical for most readers to understand‚Äù since 2014!).</span></p>
<!-- [STILL VERBATIM FROM MRM] -->
<p>Standardized effect-size measures have limitations. For example, if two interventions produce the same absolute change in the same outcome measure, but are studied in different populations in which the variability on the outcome differs substantially, the interventions would produce different standardized mean differences.  When meta-analyzing studies that measure the outcome on the same scale (e.g., blood pressure in terms of mmHg), it may often be preferable to use raw mean differences. However, in many scientific fields, studies do not measure outcomes on exactly the same scale, as in both applied examples provided here; in such cases, using standardized mean differences may enable some approximate comparison and synthesis of effect sizes across studies. Additionally, when outcomes use arbitrary or unitless raw measures (e.g., points on a Likert scale), expressing effect sizes using standardized mean differences may provide some sense of effect sizes relative to variability in that sample, similar to measures of genetic heritability. </p>
