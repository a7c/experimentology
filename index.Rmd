How do we extract generalizable insights from the vast complexity of individual human beings' behavior? The goal of this book is to provide an introduction to the workflow of the experimental researcher in the behavioral sciences. The organization of the book will be sequential, from the planning stages of the research process through design, data collection, and analysis. I will introduce these concepts via narrative examples from a range of sub-disciplines including cognitive, developmental, and social psychology. Throughout, I use examples to illustrate the pitfalls in design and analysis that led to the "replication crisis" in psychology. Across chapters, the book will emphasize three themes of successful experimental research: precision, reproducibility, and generalizability. The book takes an open-science based approach, providing students with a tutorial and justification of practices such as preregistration, data sharing, and reproducible analysis. The audience for the book is graduate students or advanced undergraduates with some domain knowledge in psychology and a basic grasp of linear regression. For relevant chapters, examples will be presented using code from R (the free statistical programming language), git (a version control system), and the open science framework (a data sharing/preregistration site). My hope is that this book provides a practical introduction for advanced students in how to do robust and replicable work as an experimental psychologist.
