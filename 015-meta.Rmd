**Hotel towel meta-analysis**

In a widely-cited study on the power of describing social norms, Goldstein, Cialdini, and Griskevicius (2008) gave one group of hotel guests a message that encouraged them to reuse their towels and another group of hotel guests a message that indicated that most other guests reused their towels. Across two studies, they found that guests who received the social norm message were more likely to reuse their towels than guests who received the control message (Study 1 *p* = .05, Study 2 *p* = .03). Five later replications, though, all failed to find significant evidence of increases in towel reuse amongst guests receiving the social norm message (all *p*s \> .05).

At first glance, you may be enticed to conclude that the effect of social norm messages does not reliably impact towel reuse. You may even go a step further and try to think of explanations for why one team found the effect, but the other did not. (Maybe the messages change behavior when guest receive nice fluffy towels, but doesn't work when guests receive sets of crappy towels.) Or, if you're a practitioner of experimentology, you may ask yourselves whether these findings are really all that different. You may even be so bold to do a meta-analysis!

If you did the latter, you would find that the results across these studies are, for the most part, quite consistent. Guests in four out of five of the studies were more likely to reuse their towels after receiving social norm messages, but the difference was not large enough in any one study to confidently conclude that this difference was larger than zero. When the results were statistically combined in a meta-analysis, Scheibehenne, Jamil, and Wagenmakers (2016) found that social norm messages *on average* do increase hotel towel reuse.

It's not magic--it's just meta-analysis! In this chapter, you'll learn more about this useful technique.

Notes to Maya: Scheibehenne et al. did not estimate heterogeneity, so I do not know how consistent these results actually are. One of the studies did actually yield a sizeable oppostite-direction effect, so I'm not really sure if their fixed-effect assumption is reasonable. (Note, this was a commentary and tutorial about Bayesian meta-analysis, not an actual meta-analysis. So some of the methodological details are somewhat weak.) We may want to look into a scenario where (a) a fixed effect meta-analysis is better justified, (b) the direction of the effects is consistent across studies, but (c) the statistical significance of the effects is not consistent across studies.

## What is meta-analysis? 

When many students hear the term "review," they probably have flashbacks to a time where they threw some search term into Google Scholar, downloaded a bunch of articles that looked interesting, spent a few hours reading those articles, and then wrote a summary of what has been learned from these studies. There's not necessarily anything wrong with this approach, but there are a few things that can be additionally learned from doing a meta-analysis.

Meta-analysis is a statistical technique for combining results from multiple studies.

In addition to reading articles, a researcher performing a meta-analysis would also extract information about the *effect size*.

After this information has been extracted, the researcher would perform an analysis where these effect sizes are combined in a single set of analyses. By combining information from multiple studies, the researcher can make a more precise estimate of the size of some effect. The researcher can also look at the extent to which this effect varies across studies. They may even them perform analyses indicating whether studies with certain characteristics systematically produce different results.

Think about how meta-analysis might give you a different impression of an area of study than a literature review. If you would have performed a literature review on studies examining the effect of social norm messaging on hotel towel re-use, you would have likely come away with the impression that there is an unreliable effect at best and no effect at worst. However, when statistically combining the results of these studies, a meta-analyst is able to see that the findings are more consistent than they appear at first glance--and that, when considering all the available evidence, it actually appears that social norm messaging does decrease hotel towel reuse. Considering that, for example, there were 1.7 billion overnight hotel bookings in the European Union alone in 2013 (Eurostat, 2015), the difference in the types of the conclusions formed by a literature review and a meta-analysis matter quite a bit!
