# Instructor's Guide {#instructors}


## Introduction 

This is an instructor’s guide to conducting replication projects in courses. 

Possible motivations for structuring a course around replication projects include: 

* **Student interest**: Allows application of course methods and lessons to a topic that is interesting to each student.
* **Usefulness**: If this course is taught in the first year of the program (as recommended), students may use their project as a way to establish. robustness of a phenomenon before building studies on top of it
* **Realism**: Real data is often messier than practice datasets typically provided for course exercises.
* **Intuition**: Final presentation of students’ replication outcomes trains students to read the literature with a better “sense” of which studies may be more likely to replicate than others. Frustrating experiences can motivate students to adopt best practices for their own future studies.
* **Logistics**: we provide some discussion of course budgets as well as sample text for course-related Institutional Review Board applications and a sample syllabus for a 10-week and 16-week version of the course. 

## Scenarios for different course layouts

First, before we dive in, we want to acknowledge that a project-based course may look very different depending on student level (undergraduate vs. graduate/post-doc level) and availability of resources at your institution for a course like this, namely in terms of TA support and course funding (for data collection). Since these considerations will likely shape some important decisions you make in designing your course, we'll address these factors here:

### Student Level:

While Psych 251 at Stanford is geared towards graduate students (and is currently a required class for entering first-year graduate students in the Psychology Department), we also accept advanced undergraduate students as well as graduate students from other departments (e.g., Education, Human-Computer Interaction, Philosophy, Computer Science). On the first day of our course, we tell students that they should be comfortable with two fo the three following topics:

1) Some knowledge of psychological experimentation & subject matter

2) Statistical programming: things like functions and variables

3) Basic statistics like ANOVA and t-test

If students are only comfortable with one of the three topics above, we warn them ahead of time that the course may demand more time from them than the average student. 

Now, if you are planning on catering this course for undergraduate students, chances are tehy have had less exposure to these toipcs overall, so there are multiple ways to calibrate the course accordingly:

1) **Prerequisites**: Require students to have completed courses that cover at least two of the three topics mentioned above (i.e., a psychology class, a class that covers statistical programming, a class that covers basic statistics, any two of the three).

2) **Pace**: unlike Psych 251, where the entire course only lasts 10 weeks, a class for undergraduates may benefit from a slower pace, allowing more time to cover the foundational principles before diving into the project. For instance, the course could be held over multiple academic semesters/quarters, with the project goal of Course #1 being choosing and planning the replication study, and the project goal of Course #2 being the execution and interpretation of the replication. 

3) **Pair-Group-Based Projects**: In Psych 251, each student is required to conduct their own replication project. However, this structure may be overwhelming for undergraduate students who may have less confidence taking on an entire replication project by themselves. One option that may alleviate this pressure is to have students conduct these projects as pairs or as small teams, so that they can collectively draw on each others' strengths. When assigning these pairs or teams, it may be especially helpful to try to ensure a relatively even balance of students who are confident in each of the three areas outlined above (psychology, statistical programming, basic statistics). 

Now that we've offered a few suggestions to address different student levels, let's dive into the issue of course resources.

## Student Assignments

### Problem Set 0: Git and Github

* Points: 5 points
* Instructions: "Submit a link to the Github repository you created. In order to receive credit, the repository must have an appropriately-formatted README file and another file with one successfully-pushed change in its history. This shows you have pushed a change in a second file to GitHub"
