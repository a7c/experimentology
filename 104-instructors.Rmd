# Introduction 

This is an instructor’s guide to conducting replication projects in courses. 

Possible motivations for structuring a course around replication projects include: 

1. **Student interest**: Allows application of course methods and lessons to a topic that is interesting to each student.
2. **Usefulness**: If this course is taught in the first year of the program (as recommended), students may use their project as a way to establish. robustness of a phenomenon before building studies on top of it
3. **Realism**: Real data is often messier than practice datasets typically provided for course exercises.
4. **Intuition**: Final presentation of students’ replication outcomes trains students to read the literature with a better “sense” of which studies may be more likely to replicate than others. Frustrating experiences can motivate students to adopt best practices for their own future studies.
5. **Logistics**: we provide some discussion of course budgets as well as sample text for course-related Institutional Review Board applications and a sample syllabus for a 10-week and 16-week version of the course.
