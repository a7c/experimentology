# Statistical models

Case study:

The t-test between two groups - our starting point. This chapter will provide a very opinionated introduction to key statistical concepts, basically building a set of tools for comparing a two-condition design in increasingly general ways. R code will be provided, but some statistical background at the level of an undergraduate course will be required. 

Effect size - a common language for describing group differences. Pros and cons of this approach. Pro: comparability across studies. Con: loss of information about measures and real-world predictions.
