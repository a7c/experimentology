Why preregister? (Hardwicke and Wagenmakers 2021)

  - Reduce bias – addresses the problem of researcher degrees of freedom and selective reporting.
  - Calibrate confidence – helps to gauge risk of bias thereby enabling proper interpretation of confirmatory vs exploratory results.
  - Increase transparency – it’s not a straightjacket that prevents you from doing anything else, it’s a snapshot of your current thinking
  - Front-load careful thinking – forces you to sit down and be careful about your thinking, often catch conceptual issues and save time in the long-run
