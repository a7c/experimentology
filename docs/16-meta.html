<h2 id="introduction-1"><span class="header-section-number">16</span> Introduction?</h2>
<p>In a widely-cited study on the power of describing social norms, Goldstein, Cialdini, and Griskevicius (2008) gave one group of hotel guests a message that encouraged them to reuse their towels and another group of hotel guests a message that indicated that most other guests reused their towels. Across two studies, they found that guests who received the social norm message were more likely to reuse their towels than guests who received the control message (Study 1 <em>p</em> = .05, Study 2 <em>p</em> = .03). Five later replications, though, all failed to find significant evidence of increases in towel reuse amongst guests receiving the social norm message (all <em>p</em>s &gt; .05).</p>
<p>At first glance, you may be enticed to conclude that the effect of social norm messages does not reliably impact towel reuse. You may even go a step further and try to think of explanations for why one team found the effect, but the other did not. (Maybe the messages change behavior when guest receive nice fluffy towels, but doesn‚Äôt work when guests receive sets of crappy towels.) Or, if you‚Äôre a practitioner of experimentology, you may ask yourselves whether these findings are really all that different. You may even be so bold to do a meta-analysis!</p>
<p>If you did the latter, you would find that the results across these studies are, for the most part, quite consistent. Guests in four out of five of the studies were more likely to reuse their towels after receiving social norm messages, but the difference was not large enough in any one study to confidently conclude that this difference was larger than zero. When the results were statistically combined in a meta-analysis, Scheibehenne, Jamil, and Wagenmakers (2016) found that social norm messages <em>on average</em> do increase hotel towel reuse.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not magic‚Äìit‚Äôs just meta-analysis! In this chapter, you‚Äôll learn more about this useful technique.</p>
<p>Notes to Maya: Scheibehenne et al.¬†did not estimate heterogeneity, so I do not know how consistent these results actually are. One of the studies did actually yield a sizeable oppostite-direction effect, so I‚Äôm not really sure if their fixed-effect assumption is reasonable. (Note, this was a commentary and tutorial about Bayesian meta-analysis, not an actual meta-analysis. So some of the methodological details are somewhat weak.) We may want to look into a scenario where (a) a fixed effect meta-analysis is better justified, (b) the direction of the effects is consistent across studies, but (c) the statistical significance of the effects is not consistent across studies.</p>
</div>
<p>What distinguishes meta-analysis from other types of reviews? Literature review typology, organized by your search, appraisal, synthesis, and analysis strategy (Grant and Booth 2009).</p>
<p>When many students hear the term ‚Äúreview,‚Äù they probably have flashbacks to a time where they threw some search term into Google Scholar, downloaded a bunch of articles that looked interesting, spent a few hours reading those articles, and then wrote a summary of what has been learned from these studies. There‚Äôs not necessarily anything wrong with this approach, but there are a few things that can be additionally learned from doing a meta-analysis.</p>
<p>Meta-analysis is a statistical technique for combining results from multiple studies.</p>
<p>In addition to reading articles, a researcher performing a meta-analysis would also extract information about the <em>effect size</em>.</p>
<p>After this information has been extracted, the researcher would perform an analysis where these effect sizes are combined in a single set of analyses. By combining information from multiple studies, the researcher can make a more precise estimate of the size of some effect. The researcher can also look at the extent to which this effect varies across studies. They may even them perform analyses indicating whether studies with certain characteristics systematically produce different results.</p>
<p>Think about how meta-analysis might give you a different impression of an area of study than a literature review. If you would have performed a literature review on studies examining the effect of social norm messaging on hotel towel re-use, you would have likely come away with the impression that there is an unreliable effect at best and no effect at worst. However, when statistically combining the results of these studies, a meta-analyst is able to see that the findings are more consistent than they appear at first glance‚Äìand that, when considering all the available evidence, it actually appears that social norm messaging does decrease hotel towel reuse. Considering that, for example, there were 1.7 billion overnight hotel bookings in the European Union alone in 2013 (Eurostat, 2015), the difference in the types of the conclusions formed by a literature review and a meta-analysis matter quite a bit!</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.2</span> Intuitive, but problematic, approaches to evidence synthesis</h2>
<p>We have seen why it is important to synthesize evidence across studies on the same topic rather than just focus on one study at a time. How should we actually do this in practice? When considering evidence across multiple studies, what most of us do intuitively is simply to count how many studies supported the hypothesis under investigation, versus how many did not support the hypothesis. Such a count usually amounts to counting the number of studies with ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values, since (for better or for worse) ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù is largely what drives studies‚Äô take-home conclusions (<span class="citation">McShane and Gal (<label for="tufte-mn-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-1" class="margin-toggle">2017<span class="marginnote">McShane, Blakeley B, and David Gal. 2017. ‚ÄúStatistical Significance and the Dichotomization of Evidence.‚Äù <em>Journal of the American Statistical Association</em> 112 (519): 885‚Äì95. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2017.1289846">https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2017.1289846</a>.</span>)</span>; <span class="citation">Nelson, Rosenthal, and Rosnow (<label for="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle">1986<span class="marginnote">Nelson, Nanette, Robert Rosenthal, and Ralph L Rosnow. 1986. ‚ÄúInterpretation of Significance Levels and Effect Sizes by Psychological Researchers.‚Äù <em>American Psychologist</em> 41 (11): 1299.</span>)</span>). This is called ‚Äú<strong>vote-counting</strong>‚Äù (<span class="citation">Borenstein et al. (<label for="tufte-mn-3" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-3" class="margin-toggle">2021<span class="marginnote">Borenstein, Michael, Larry V Hedges, Julian PT Higgins, and Hannah R Rothstein. 2021. <em>Introduction to Meta-Analysis</em>. John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons.</span>)</span>). For example, in Paluck et al.‚Äôs meta-analysis on the contact hypothesis, 11 of 27 (EYEBALLED) studies were significant, all with positive point estimates. So, based on this vote-count, we would have the impression that most studies do not support the contact hypothesis. Indeed, many narrative reviews take essentially this vote-counting approach as well, albeit often not explicitly.</p>
<p>Despite its intuitive appeal, vote-counting can be very misleading because this approach characterizes evidence solely in terms of dichotomized <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values, while entirely ignoring effect sizes. In Chapter <a href="2-replication.html#replication">2</a> on replication, we saw how this fetishism of statistical ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù can mislead in the context of individual studies, and these problems propagate to vote-counting statistical ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù across studies as well. For example, it could be the case that relatively few studies are ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù (for example, in a literature of typically small studies), yet if the studies typically have large point estimates, then the consensus of evidence could actually be quite strong. Or inversely, it could be that nearly all studies are ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù, but if they typically have small point estimates, then the consensus of evidence might still be rather weak. In these cases, vote-counting could lead us badly astray (<span class="citation">Borenstein et al. (<label for="tufte-mn-4" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-4" class="margin-toggle">2021<span class="marginnote">Borenstein, Michael, Larry V Hedges, Julian PT Higgins, and Hannah R Rothstein. 2021. <em>Introduction to Meta-Analysis</em>. John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons.</span>)</span>).</p>
<p>To avoid these pitfalls, a principled evidence synthesis needs to account for effect sizes themselves. How about if we just average the studies‚Äô estimates? For example, in Paluck et al.‚Äôs meta-analysis, the mean of the studies‚Äô estimates is XXX. This approach is perhaps a step in the right direction, but still has some important limitations. In particular, this approach gives equal weight to each study, such that a small study (like Hull et al., with a sample size of XXX [note: this had the second-smallest RE weight]) contributes as much to the mean effect size as a large study (like Boisjoly et al., with a sample size of XXX [note: this had the highest RE weight]). That doesn‚Äôt make sense: larger studies should clearly carry more weight in the analysis. This brings us to our first principled approach to meta-analysis, namely fixed-effects meta-analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="fixed-effects-meta-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.3</span> Fixed-effects meta-analysis</h2>
<p>Fixed-effects meta-analysis is a simple way to average studies‚Äô estimates while giving more weight to larger studies. Specifically, fixed-effects meta-analysis is a weighted average in which each study‚Äôs estimate is weighted by its inverse-variance (i.e., the inverse of its squared standard error). This makes sense because larger, more precise studies have smaller variances, so they should get more weight in the analysis. The fixed-effects pooled estimate is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\widehat{\mu} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \widehat{\theta}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^k w_i}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the number of studies, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}_i\)</span> is the point estimate of the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> study, and <span class="math inline">\(w_i = 1/\widehat{\sigma}^2_i\)</span> is study <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>‚Äôs weight in the analysis (i.e., the inverse of its variance).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Do we want to show the SE for <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span>?]</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="applied-example" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.3.1</span> Applied example</h3>
<p>In Paluck et al.‚Äôs meta-analysis, we would calculate the fixed-effects estimate, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span>, as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[SHOW ARITHMETIC FOR THE FIRST FEW STUDIES].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We thus estimate that the effect size in this studies is a standardized mean difference of <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu} = XXX\)</span>; 95% confidence interval: [XXX]; <span class="math inline">\(p=\)</span>XXX. That is, we estimated that intergroup contact was associated with a decrease in prejudice of XXX standard deviations.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations-of-fixed-effects-meta-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.3.2</span> Limitations of fixed-effects meta-analysis</h3>
<p>Fixed-effects meta-analysis does have important limitations. To see the problem intuitively, imagine we actually had the full dataset of individual observations from each study. (This is what meta-analysts dream of, but it‚Äôs rarely feasible in practice.) Fixed-effects meta-analysis is like simply concatenating all the studies‚Äô datasets and then calculating the effect size, ignoring that observations came from different studies.</p>
<p>But what if the studies differ from one another? For example, in Paluck et al.‚Äôs meta-analysis, many design elements differed in ways that could make the interventions more or less effective in different studies: some studies recruited adult participants while others recruited children, some studies considered contact between participants of different races while others considered contact between participants of different ages, and so on. This means that the contact effect could actually differ across studies: the effects could be <strong>heterogeneous</strong>.</p>
<p>Does this presence of heterogeneity remind you of anything from when we analyzed repeated-measures data in Chapter <a href="7-models.html#models">7</a> on models? Recall that, with repeated-measures data, we had dealt with the possibility of heterogeneity across participants by introducing random intercepts by participant to our regression model. We can do much the same thing in meta-analysis; let‚Äôs turn to this now.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="random-effects-meta-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.4</span> Random-effects meta-analysis</h2>
<p>Whereas fixed-effects meta-analysis essentially postulates that all studies in the meta-analysis have the same population effect size, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, random-effects meta-analysis instead postulates that studies‚Äô population effects come from a normal distribution<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> Technically, other specifications of random-effects meta-analysis are possible. For example, robust variance estimation does not require making assumptions about the distribution of effects across studies (<span class="citation">Hedges, Tipton, and Johnson (<label for="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle">2010<span class="marginnote">Hedges, Larry V, Elizabeth Tipton, and Matthew C Johnson. 2010. ‚ÄúRobust Variance Estimation in Meta-Regression with Dependent Effect Size Estimates.‚Äù <em>Research Synthesis Methods</em> 1 (1): 39‚Äì65.</span>)</span>).</span> with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. The larger the standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, the more heterogeneous the effects are across studies. A random-effects model then tries to estimate both <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, for example by maximum likelihood (<span class="citation">DerSimonian and Laird (<label for="tufte-mn-6" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-6" class="margin-toggle">1986<span class="marginnote">DerSimonian, Rebecca, and Nan Laird. 1986. ‚ÄúMeta-Analysis in Clinical Trials.‚Äù <em>Controlled Clinical Trials</em> 7 (3): 177‚Äì88.</span>)</span>; <span class="citation">Brockwell and Gordon (<label for="tufte-mn-7" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-7" class="margin-toggle">2001<span class="marginnote">Brockwell, Sarah E, and Ian R Gordon. 2001. ‚ÄúA Comparison of Statistical Methods for Meta-Analysis.‚Äù <em>Statistics in Medicine</em> 20 (6): 825‚Äì40.</span>)</span>).</p>
<p>In practice, the estimate <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span> is still a weighted average of studies‚Äô estimates, as for fixed-effects meta-analysis:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\widehat{\mu} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \widehat{\theta}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^k w_i}\]</span>
but the inverse-variance weights now incorporate the heterogeneity as well: <span class="math inline">\(w_i = 1/\left(\widehat{\tau}^2 + \widehat{\sigma}^2_i \right)\)</span>. These weights represent the inverse of studies‚Äô <em>marginal</em> variances, comprising not only statistical error due to their finite sample sizes (<span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\sigma}^2_i\)</span>) but also genuine effect heterogeneity (<span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\tau}^2\)</span>).<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> The estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\tau}^2\)</span> is a bit more complicated, but is essentially a weighted average of studies‚Äô residuals, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta_i} - \widehat{\mu}\)</span>, while subtracting away variation due to statistical error, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\sigma}^2_i\)</span> (<span class="citation">DerSimonian and Laird (<label for="tufte-mn-8" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-8" class="margin-toggle">1986<span class="marginnote">DerSimonian, Rebecca, and Nan Laird. 1986. ‚ÄúMeta-Analysis in Clinical Trials.‚Äù <em>Controlled Clinical Trials</em> 7 (3): 177‚Äì88.</span>)</span>; <span class="citation">Brockwell and Gordon (<label for="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle">2001<span class="marginnote">Brockwell, Sarah E, and Ian R Gordon. 2001. ‚ÄúA Comparison of Statistical Methods for Meta-Analysis.‚Äù <em>Statistics in Medicine</em> 20 (6): 825‚Äì40.</span>)</span>).</span></p>
<p>The upshot is that small studies contribute more strongly to a random-effects meta-analysis (i.e., they have larger weights) than they do to a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Additionally, confidence intervals are typically wider in random-effects meta-analysis than in fixed-effects meta-analysis; heuristically, this is because random-effects meta-analysis has to draw inference to a distribution of heterogeneous effects rather than to only one population effect that is shared by all studies.</p>

<p>Remember that in random-effects meta-analysis, the estimate <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span> represents only the <em>mean</em> population effect across studies.

<p>Within-study biases affect the internal validity of the meta-analyzed studies‚Äô internal validity and include, for example, XXX (Chapter XXX; [use examples of types of bias that were discussed earlier]). For example, in Paluck et al.‚Äôs meta-analysis, XXX.</p>
<p>These within-study biases can propagate to the results of the meta-analysis. To mitigate this problem, meta-analysts should try to define study eligibility criteria that reduce within-study biases and, after data have been collected, should qualitatively assess studies‚Äô risks of bias using established rating tools (<span class="citation">Mathur and VanderWeele (<label for="tufte-mn-13" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-13" class="margin-toggle">2022<span class="marginnote">Mathur, Maya B, and Tyler J VanderWeele. 2022. ‚ÄúMethods to Address Confounding and Other Biases in Meta-Analyses: Review and Recommendations.‚Äù <em>Annual Review of Public Health</em>.</span>)</span>). Additionally, it is often informative to conduct quantitative quantitatively assess how sensitive meta-analysis results may be to residual bias that cannot be eliminated by limiting study eligibility (<span class="citation">Mathur and VanderWeele (<label for="tufte-mn-14" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-14" class="margin-toggle">2022<span class="marginnote">Mathur, Maya B, and Tyler J VanderWeele. 2022. ‚ÄúMethods to Address Confounding and Other Biases in Meta-Analyses: Review and Recommendations.‚Äù <em>Annual Review of Public Health</em>.</span>)</span>).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.5.2</span> Across-study biases</h3>
<p>Across-study biases affect the meta-analyzed literature holistically and include, for example, publication bias and selective reporting, as discussed in Chapter XXX. Often, these across-study biases favor statistically significant positive results; in this case, results that survive to publication and inclusion in the meta-analysis will typically have inflated estimates (they are too large compared to the truth) and so result in an inflated meta-analytic estimate. As was the case for within-study biases, meta-analysts should try to mitigate across-study biases both through prevention and . That is, meta-analysis inclusion criteria should be designed to cast a broad net, capturing not only high-profile, published studies on the topic, but also studies published in low-profile journals, and ‚Äúgray literature‚Äù such as unpublished dissertations and theses. A broad search will also help capture not only studies in which the analysis that is relevant to the meta-analysis was primary ‚Äúheadline‚Äù finding, but also studies that reported the relevant analysis only as a secondary or supplemental result (perhaps because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù!)

<p>There are also statistical methods to help assess how robust the results may be to across-study biases. Among the most popular tools to assess and correct for publication bias is the <strong>funnel plot</strong> (<span class="citation">Duval and Tweedie (<label for="tufte-mn-16" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-16" class="margin-toggle">2000<span class="marginnote">Duval, Sue, and Richard Tweedie. 2000. ‚ÄúTrim and Fill: A Simple Funnel-Plot‚ÄìBased Method of Testing and Adjusting for Publication Bias in Meta-Analysis.‚Äù <em>Biometrics</em> 56 (2): 455‚Äì63. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00455.x">https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00455.x</a>.</span>)</span>; <span class="citation">Egger et al.

Funnel plots are usually interpreted as indicating publication bias when they are asymmetric, that is, when smaller studies tend to have larger point estimates. Several popular statistical methods, such as Trim-and-Fill (<span class="citation">Duval and Tweedie (<label for="tufte-mn-18" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-18" class="margin-toggle">2000<span class="marginnote">Duval, Sue, and Richard Tweedie. 2000. ‚ÄúTrim and Fill: A Simple Funnel-Plot‚ÄìBased Method of Testing and Adjusting for Publication Bias in Meta-Analysis.‚Äù <em>Biometrics</em> 56 (2): 455‚Äì63. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00455.x">https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00455.x</a>.</span>)</span>) and Egger‚Äôs regression (<span class="citation">Egger et al.

Funnel plot methods can be useful to assess whether the effect sizes differ systematically between small and large studies. These <strong>‚Äúsmall-study effects‚Äù</strong> could arise not only from publication bias but also from genuine substantive differences between small and large studies (<span class="citation">Egger et al.

For example, in a meta-analysis of intervention studies, if the most effective interventions are also the most expensive or difficult to implement, these highly effective interventions might be used primarily in the smallest studies. Funnel plot methods detect these types of small-study effects as well as those arising from publication bias.</p>
