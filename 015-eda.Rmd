# Exploratory data analysis {#eda}

::: {.learning-goals}
üçé Learning goals: Explain how to evaluate the sensitivity of main analyses to modeling assumptions, describe how modeling and data visualization support data analysis, compare individual and item differences. 
:::

::: {.case-study}
üî¨ Case study: Frank, Vul, & Johnson (2009) report a small subset of the many many analyses they ran on a very rich dataset. Luckily, the simplest analysis was the most important, and that one was replicable (Frank, Amso, and Johnson 2014).

Fancy stuff and when it is and isn‚Äôt appropriate

- Dimensionality reduction: factor analysis and PCA (when these techniques are useful, and roughly what they do; no mathematical exploration). 
- Using cognitive models as predictors: an exciting way of making quantitative links between theory and data.
- Exploiting variation: individual differences and item differences. (Some discussion of psychometric models like item response theory as a way of exploring this variation).
