Defining the concepts of reproducibility and replication

- We describe the framework for replication in Zwaan et al. (2018), highlighting the idea of multiple dimensions on which a replication can differ from the original study and the ways that this complicates inferences about replication ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù (Mathur and VanderWeele 2019, 2020).
- We can get different epistemic value from doing direct replications (attempt to copy original study with as much fidelity as possible) vs. conceptual replications (attempt to somewhat perturb operationalization of original study).

:::

How do reproducibility and replicability contribute to theory building? We draw on Hardwicke et al. (2018), considering these factors in the informativeness of an experiment.


Introduce p-hacking and publication biases as major sources of irreproducibility. These are biases - and we highlight bias reduction as a key goal.
