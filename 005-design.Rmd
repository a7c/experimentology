A randomized experiment is a combination of a manipulation and a measure. We talked about measures in Chapter \@ref(measurement); our topic in the current chapter is manipulations. This topic is commonly referred to as "design of experiments."


To be useful, a measure must be a valid measure of a construct of interest. The same is true for a manipulation -- it must validly relate to the causal effect of interest. We'll begin by talking about issues of **manipulation validity**, including both issues of ecological validity and **confounding**. We'll talk about how practices like **randomization** and **counterbalancing** can help remove nuisance confounds.^[This section will draw on our introduction of causal inference in Chapter \@ref(intro), so if you haven't read that, now's the time.]

## Manipulation validity

### Threats to manipulation validity

 - Manipulations must correspond to the construct whose causal effect is being estimated.
 
  - Demand characteristics. How did concerns about demand characteristics emerge? What proposed mechanisms cause demand characteristics to influence participant behavior? What evidence do we have that demand characteristics impact participant behavior? And what strategies can we use to mitigate demand characteristics?
  
### Confounding


Let's consider an alternate experiment now. Suppose we did the same basic procedure, but now with a "within-subjects" design where participants do both the Dylan treatment and the control, in that order. This experiment is flawed, of course. If you observe a Dylan effect, you can't rule out the idea that participants got tired and wrote worse in the control condition because it always came second.

Order (Dylan first vs. control first; notated X') is an experimental confound: a variable that is created in the course of the experiment that is both causally related to the predictor and potentially also related to the outcome. Here's how the causal model now looks:




We've reconstructed the same kind of confounding relationship we had with age, where we had a variable (X') that was correlated both with our predictor (X) and our outcome (Y)! So...



In the causal language we have been using, counterbalancing allows us to snip out the causal dependency between order and Dylan. Now they are unconfounded (uncorrelated) with one another. We've "solved" a confound in our experimental design. Here's the picture:


These are not covariates! Covariates are related but don't have causal force in this design because of randomization. We can use them in our analysis to make our estimates more precise (see Chapter \@ref(models)), but we won't worry about them here. If someone says to you, "participant gender is a confound in your experiment", if you've done random assignment to condition appropriately (acoss genders), you should say "no it's not."

### Removing nuisance confounds

 What should we do with our experimental confounds? 

Option 1. Randomize. Increasingly, this is my go-to method for dealing with any confound. Is the correct answer on my survey confounded with response side? Randomize what side the response shows up on! Is order confounded with condition? Randomize the order you present in! Randomization is much easier now that we program many of our experiments using software like Qualtrics or code them from scratch in JavaScript.

The only time you really get in trouble with randomization is when you have a large number of options, a small number of participants, or some combination of the two. In this case, you can end up with unbalanced levels of the randomized factors (for example, ten answers on the right side and two on the left). Averaging across many experiments, this lack of balance will come out in the wash. But in a single experiment, it can really mess up your data ‚Äì especially if your participants notice and start choosing one side more than the other because it's right more often. For that reason, when balance is critical, you want option 2.

Option 2. Counterbalance. If you think a particular confound might have a significant effect on your measure, balancing it across participants and across trials is a very safe choice. That way, you are guaranteed to have no effect of the confound on your average effect. In a simple counterbalance of order for our Dylan experiment, we manipulate condition order between subjects. Some participants hear Dylan first and others hear Dylan second. Although technically we might call order a second "factor" in the experiment, in practice it's really just a nuisance variable, so we don't talk about it as a factor and we often don't analyze it (but see Option 3 below).

Counterbalancing doesn't always work, though. It gets trickier when you have too many levels on a variable (too many Dylan songs!) or multiple confounding variables. For example, if you have lots of different nuisance variables ‚Äì say, condition order, what writing prompt you use for each order, which Dylan song you play ‚Äì it may not be possible to do a fully-crossed counterbalance so that all combinations of these factors are seen by equal numbers of participants. In these kinds of cases, you may have to rely on partial counterbalancing schemes or latin squares designs, or you may have to fall back on randomization.

Option 3. Do Options 1 and 2 and then model the variation. This option was never part of my training, but it's an interesting third option that I'm increasingly considering.** That is, we are often faced with the choice between A) a noisy between-participants design and B) a lower-noise within-participants design that nevertheless adds noise back in via some obvious order effect that you have to randomize or counterbalance. In a recent talk by Andrew Gelman, he suggested that we try to model these as covariates, to reduce noise. This seems like a pretty interesting suggestion, especially if the correlation between them and the outcome is substantial.***

## How to design a manipulation to test a theory.

Simplicity as a key design principle

  - E. O. Wilson‚Äôs advice: iteration on a repeatable measurement.
  - Statistical and interpretability concerns for complex interaction designs.
  - Nuisance variables: counterbalancing and randomization.

The temptation to manipulate lots of things

Again, we advocate for simplicity.

The advice is out there to
