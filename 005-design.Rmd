🍎 Learning goals: Describe key elements to designing a manipulation, define “randomization” and “counterbalancing”, discuss strategies to design experiments that are appropriate to the populations of interest.

🔬 Case study: The “suspicious coincidence” effect (Xu and Tenenbaum 2007) with non-replication by Spencer et al. (2011) resolved by Lewis & Frank (2018) “still suspicious” paper.

Manipulation Validity

  - Manipulations must correspond to the construct whose causal effect is being estimated.
  - Demand characteristics. How did concerns about demand characteristics emerge? What proposed mechanisms cause demand characteristics to influence participant behavior? What evidence do we have that demand characteristics impact participant behavior? And what strategies can we use to mitigate demand characteristics?

How to design a manipulation to test a theory.

  - The ethics of the “dead on arrival” experiment – why appropriate experimental design is an ethical imperative (we “waste” participant contributions otherwise).
  - Back to (Meehl 1978) idea of “risky tests”: those that will best help adjudicate between theories.
  - Optimal experiment design in psychophysics and beyond – how to use quantitative models to select the stimulus that maximizes your chances of a theory-informing result.

Simplicity as a key design principle

  - E. O. Wilson’s advice: iteration on a repeatable measurement.
  - Statistical and interpretability concerns for complex interaction designs.
  - Nuisance variables: counterbalancing and randomization.

Designing for your sample: how to ensure the appropriateness of your paradigm for the population you want to measure. 

  - Best practices for pilot studies.
  - Best practices for manipulation and comprehension checks.
