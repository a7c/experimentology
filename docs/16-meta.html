<div class="case-study">
<p>üî¨ Case study: Hotel towel reuse (Scheibehenne, Jamil, and Wagenmakers 2016). A simple example of aggregating noisy evidence from replications.</p>
<p>In a widely-cited study on the power of describing social norms, Goldstein, Cialdini, and Griskevicius (2008) gave one group of hotel guests a message that encouraged them to reuse their towels and another group of hotel guests a message that indicated that most other guests reused their towels. Across two studies, they found that guests who received the social norm message were more likely to reuse their towels than guests who received the control message (Study 1 <em>p</em> = .05, Study 2 <em>p</em> = .03). Five later replications, though, all failed to find significant evidence of increases in towel reuse among guests receiving the social norm message (all <em>p</em>s &gt; .05).</p>
<p>At first glance, you may be enticed to conclude that the effect of social norm messages does not reliably impact towel reuse. You may even go a step further and try to think of explanations for why one team found the effect, but the other did not. (Maybe the messages change behavior when guest receive nice fluffy towels, but doesn‚Äôt work when guests receive sets of crappy towels.) Or, if you‚Äôre a practitioner of experimentology, you may quantitatively synthesize the evidence via meta-analysis!</p>
<p>If you did the latter, you would find that the results across these studies are, for the most part, quite consistent. Guests in four out of five of the studies were more likely to reuse their towels after receiving social norm messages, but the difference was not large enough in most studies to confidently conclude that this difference was larger than zero. When the results were statistically combined in a meta-analysis, Scheibehenne, Jamil, and Wagenmakers (2016) found that social norm messages do <em>on average</em> do increase hotel towel reuse.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not magic‚Äìit‚Äôs just meta-analysis! In this chapter, you‚Äôll learn more about this useful technique.</p>
</div>
<p>What distinguishes meta-analysis from other types of reviews? Literature review typology, organized by your search, appraisal, synthesis, and analysis strategy (Grant and Booth 2009).</p>
<p>When many students hear the term ‚Äúreview,‚Äù they probably have flashbacks to a time where they threw some search term into Google Scholar, downloaded a bunch of articles that looked interesting, spent a few hours reading those articles, and then wrote a summary of what has been learned from these studies. There‚Äôs not necessarily anything wrong with this approach, but there are a few things that can be additionally learned from doing a meta-analysis.</p>
<p>Meta-analysis is a statistical technique for combining results from multiple studies.</p>
<p>In addition to reading articles, a researcher performing a meta-analysis would also extract information about the <em>effect size</em>.</p>
<p>After this information has been extracted, the researcher would perform an analysis where these effect sizes are combined in a single set of analyses. By combining information from multiple studies, the researcher can make a more precise estimate of the size of some effect. The researcher can also look at the extent to which this effect varies across studies. They may even them perform analyses indicating whether studies with certain characteristics systematically produce different results.</p>
<p>Think about how meta-analysis might give you a different impression of an area of study than a literature review. If you would have performed a literature review on studies examining the effect of social norm messaging on hotel towel re-use, you would have likely come away with the impression that there is an unreliable effect at best and no effect at worst. However, when statistically combining the results of these studies, a meta-analyst is able to see that the findings are more consistent than they appear at first glance‚Äìand that, when considering all the available evidence, it actually appears that social norm messaging does decrease hotel towel reuse. Considering that, for example, there were 1.7 billion overnight hotel bookings in the European Union alone in 2013 (Eurostat, 2015), the difference in the types of the conclusions formed by a literature review and a meta-analysis matter quite a bit!</p>

<div id="running-example-the-contact-hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.1</span> Running example: The contact hypothesis</h2>
<p>For more than a century, social scientists have sought to understand and mitigate prejudice. One influential idea, the <em>contact hypothesis</em>, posits that prejudice ‚Äúmay be reduced by equal status contact between majority and minority groups in the pursuit of common goals‚Äù (Allport, 1954, p.¬†281).</p>
<p>In a recent meta-analysis, Paluck et al.¬†(2019) sought to examine whether randomly-assigned contact interventions had long-term effects on prejudice-related outcomes. We use this meta-analysis as the running example throughout this chapter, highlighting how various meta-analytic tools have provided invaluable insights about this important question.</p>
</div>
<div id="intuitive-but-problematic-approaches-to-evidence-synthesis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.2</span> Intuitive, but problematic, approaches to evidence synthesis</h2>
<p>When considering evidence across multiple studies, what most of us do intuitively is simply to count how many studies supported the hypothesis under investigation, versus how many did not support the hypothesis. Such a count usually amounts to counting the number of studies with ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values, since (for better or for worse) ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù is largely what drives studies‚Äô take-home conclusions (<span class="citation">McShane and Gal (<label for="tufte-mn-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-1" class="margin-toggle">2017<span class="marginnote">McShane, Blakeley B, and David Gal. 2017. ‚ÄúStatistical Significance and the Dichotomization of Evidence.‚Äù <em>Journal of the American Statistical Association</em> 112 (519): 885‚Äì95. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2017.1289846">https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2017.1289846</a>.</span>)</span>; <span class="citation">Nelson, Rosenthal, and Rosnow (<label for="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle">1986<span class="marginnote">Nelson, Nanette, Robert Rosenthal, and Ralph L Rosnow. 1986. ‚ÄúInterpretation of Significance Levels and Effect Sizes by Psychological Researchers.‚Äù <em>American Psychologist</em> 41 (11): 1299.</span>)</span>). This is called ‚Äú<strong>vote-counting</strong>‚Äù (<span class="citation">Borenstein et al. (<label for="tufte-mn-3" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-3" class="margin-toggle">2021<span class="marginnote">Borenstein, Michael, Larry V Hedges, Julian PT Higgins, and Hannah R Rothstein. 2021. <em>Introduction to Meta-Analysis</em>. John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons.</span>)</span>). For example, in Paluck et al.‚Äôs meta-analysis on the contact hypothesis, 11 of 27 (EYEBALLED) studies were significant, all with positive point estimates. So, based on this vote-count, we would have the impression that most studies do not support the contact hypothesis. Indeed, many narrative reviews take essentially this vote-counting approach as well, albeit often not explicitly.</p>
<p>Despite its intuitive appeal, vote-counting can be very misleading because this approach characterizes evidence solely in terms of dichotomized <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values, while entirely ignoring effect sizes. In Chapter <a href="2-replication.html#replication">2</a> on replication, we saw how this fetishism of statistical ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù can mislead us when we consider individual studies, and these problems propagate if we vote-count statistical ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù across studies as well. For example, it could be the case that relatively few studies are ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù (for example, in a literature of typically small studies), yet if the studies typically have large point estimates, then the consensus of evidence could actually be quite strong. Or inversely, it could be that nearly all studies are ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù, but if they typically have small point estimates, then the consensus of evidence might still be rather weak. In these cases, vote-counting could lead us badly astray (<span class="citation">Borenstein et al. (<label for="tufte-mn-4" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-4" class="margin-toggle">2021<span class="marginnote">Borenstein, Michael, Larry V Hedges, Julian PT Higgins, and Hannah R Rothstein. 2021. <em>Introduction to Meta-Analysis</em>. John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons.</span>)</span>).</p>
<p>To avoid these pitfalls, a principled evidence synthesis needs to account for effect sizes themselves. How about if we just average the studies‚Äô estimates? For example, in Paluck et al.‚Äôs meta-analysis, the mean of the studies‚Äô estimates is XXX. This approach is perhaps a step in the right direction, but still has some important limitations. In particular, this approach gives equal weight to each study, such that a small study (like Hull et al., with a sample size of XXX [note: this had the second-smallest RE weight]) contributes as much to the mean effect size as a large study (like Boisjoly et al., with a sample size of XXX [note: this had the highest RE weight]). That doesn‚Äôt make sense: larger studies should clearly carry more weight in the analysis. This brings us to our first principled approach to meta-analysis, namely fixed-effects meta-analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="combining-results-across-studies-using-fixed-effects-meta-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.3</span> Combining results across studies using fixed-effects meta-analysis</h2>
<p>Fixed-effects meta-analysis is a simple way to average studies‚Äô estimates while giving more weight to larger studies. Specifically, fixed-effects meta-analysis is a weighted average in which each study‚Äôs estimate is weighted by its inverse-variance (i.e., the inverse of its squared standard error). This makes sense because larger, more precise studies have smaller variances, so they should get more weight in the analysis. The fixed-effects pooled estimate is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\widehat{\mu} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \widehat{\theta}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^k w_i}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the number of studies, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta}_i\)</span> is the point estimate of the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> study, and <span class="math inline">\(w_i = 1/\widehat{\sigma}^2_i\)</span> is study <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>‚Äôs weight in the analysis (i.e., the inverse of its variance).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Do we want to show the SE for <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span>?] NC: I am conflicted about this. On one hand, it seems odd that we don‚Äôt give any information about how one would perform a hypothesis test with the overall effect size estimate. On the other hand, I don‚Äôt want to scare people with too many equations. Maybe we can address this concern by explaining in simple language what the equations are doing and then putting the actual equation in the margin?</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="applied-example" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.3.1</span> Applied example</h3>
<p>In Paluck et al.‚Äôs meta-analysis, we would calculate the fixed-effects estimate, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span>, as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[SHOW ARITHMETIC FOR THE FIRST FEW STUDIES].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We thus estimate that the effect size in this studies is a standardized mean difference of <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu} = XXX\)</span>; 95% confidence interval: [XXX]; <span class="math inline">\(p=\)</span>XXX. That is, we estimated that intergroup contact was associated with a decrease in prejudice of XXX standard deviations.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations-of-fixed-effects-meta-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.3.2</span> Limitations of fixed-effects meta-analysis</h3>
<p>Fixed-effects meta-analysis does have important limitations. To see this intuitively, imagine we actually had the full dataset of individual observations from each study. (This is what meta-analysts dream of, but it‚Äôs rarely feasible in practice.) Fixed-effects meta-analysis is like simply concatenating all the studies‚Äô datasets and then calculating the effect size, ignoring that observations came from different studies.</p>
<p>But what if the studies differ from one another? For example, in Paluck et al.‚Äôs meta-analysis, many design elements differed in ways that could make the interventions more or less effective in different studies: some studies recruited adult participants while others recruited children, some studies considered contact between participants of different races while others considered contact between participants of different ages, and so on. This means that the contact effect could actually differ across studies: the effects could be <strong>heterogeneous</strong>.</p>
<p>Does this presence of heterogeneity remind you of anything from when we analyzed repeated-measures data in Chapter <a href="5-models.html#models">5</a> on models? Recall that, with repeated-measures data, we had dealt with the possibility of heterogeneity across participants by introducing random intercepts by participant to our regression model. We can do much the same thing in meta-analysis; let‚Äôs turn to this now.</p>

</div>
<div id="random-effects-meta-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.4</span> Random-effects meta-analysis</h2>
<p>Whereas fixed-effects meta-analysis essentially postulates that all studies in the meta-analysis have the same population effect size, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, random-effects meta-analysis instead postulates that studies‚Äô population effects come from a normal distribution<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> Technically, other specifications of random-effects meta-analysis are possible. For example, robust variance estimation does not require making assumptions about the distribution of effects across studies (<span class="citation">Hedges, Tipton, and Johnson (<label for="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle">2010<span class="marginnote">Hedges, Larry V, Elizabeth Tipton, and Matthew C Johnson. 2010. ‚ÄúRobust Variance Estimation in Meta-Regression with Dependent Effect Size Estimates.‚Äù <em>Research Synthesis Methods</em> 1 (1): 39‚Äì65.</span>)</span>). These approaches also have other substantial advantages, like their ability to handle effects that are clustered (e.g., because some papers contribute multiple estimates; <span class="citation">Hedges, Tipton, and Johnson (<label for="tufte-mn-6" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-6" class="margin-toggle">2010<span class="marginnote">Hedges, Larry V, Elizabeth Tipton, and Matthew C Johnson. 2010. ‚ÄúRobust Variance Estimation in Meta-Regression with Dependent Effect Size Estimates.‚Äù <em>Research Synthesis Methods</em> 1 (1): 39‚Äì65.</span>)</span>; <span class="citation">Pustejovsky and Tipton (<label for="tufte-mn-7" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-7" class="margin-toggle">2021<span class="marginnote">Pustejovsky, James E, and Elizabeth Tipton. 2021. ‚ÄúMeta-Analysis with Robust Variance Estimation: Expanding the Range of Working Models.‚Äù <em>Prevention Science</em>, 1‚Äì14.</span>)</span>) and their ability to provide better inference in meta-analyses with relatively few studies (<span class="citation">Tipton (<label for="tufte-mn-8" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-8" class="margin-toggle">2015<span class="marginnote">Tipton, Elizabeth. 2015. ‚ÄúSmall Sample Adjustments for Robust Variance Estimation with Meta-Regression.‚Äù <em>Psychological Methods</em> 20 (3): 375.</span>)</span>). For these reasons, we tend to use these methods by default when conducting meta-analyses.</span> with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. The larger the standard deviation, <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, the more heterogeneous the effects are across studies. A random-effects model then estimates both <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, for example by maximum likelihood (<span class="citation">DerSimonian and Laird (<label for="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle">1986<span class="marginnote">DerSimonian, Rebecca, and Nan Laird. 1986. ‚ÄúMeta-Analysis in Clinical Trials.‚Äù <em>Controlled Clinical Trials</em> 7 (3): 177‚Äì88.</span>)</span>; <span class="citation">Brockwell and Gordon (<label for="tufte-mn-10" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-10" class="margin-toggle">2001<span class="marginnote">Brockwell, Sarah E, and Ian R Gordon. 2001. ‚ÄúA Comparison of Statistical Methods for Meta-Analysis.‚Äù <em>Statistics in Medicine</em> 20 (6): 825‚Äì40.</span>)</span>).</p>
<p>The resulting estimate <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span> is still a weighted average of studies‚Äô estimates, as for fixed-effects meta-analysis:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\widehat{\mu} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \widehat{\theta}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^k w_i}\]</span> but the inverse-variance weights now incorporate the heterogeneity as well: <span class="math inline">\(w_i = 1/\left(\widehat{\tau}^2 + \widehat{\sigma}^2_i \right)\)</span>. These weights represent the inverse of studies‚Äô <em>marginal</em> variances, comprising not only statistical error due to their finite sample sizes (<span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\sigma}^2_i\)</span>) but also genuine effect heterogeneity (<span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\tau}^2\)</span>).<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> The estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\tau}^2\)</span> is a bit more complicated, but is essentially a weighted average of studies‚Äô residuals, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\theta_i} - \widehat{\mu}\)</span>, while subtracting away variation due to statistical error, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\sigma}^2_i\)</span> (<span class="citation">DerSimonian and Laird (<label for="tufte-mn-11" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-11" class="margin-toggle">1986<span class="marginnote">DerSimonian, Rebecca, and Nan Laird. 1986. ‚ÄúMeta-Analysis in Clinical Trials.‚Äù <em>Controlled Clinical Trials</em> 7 (3): 177‚Äì88.</span>)</span>; <span class="citation">Brockwell and Gordon (<label for="tufte-mn-12" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-12" class="margin-toggle">2001<span class="marginnote">Brockwell, Sarah E, and Ian R Gordon. 2001. ‚ÄúA Comparison of Statistical Methods for Meta-Analysis.‚Äù <em>Statistics in Medicine</em> 20 (6): 825‚Äì40.</span>)</span>).</span></p>
<p>The upshot is that small studies contribute more strongly to a random-effects meta-analysis (i.e., they have larger weights) than they do to a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Additionally, confidence intervals are typically wider in random-effects meta-analysis than in fixed-effects meta-analysis; heuristically, this is because random-effects meta-analysis has to draw inference to a distribution of heterogeneous effects rather than to only one population effect that is shared by all studies.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.5</span> Bias in meta-analysis</h2>
<p>Meta-analysis is an invaluable tool to synthesize evidence across studies. However, meta-analyses can be compromised by two categories of bias: <strong>within-study biases</strong> and <strong>across-study biases</strong>. Either type of bias can lead to meta-analysis estimates that are too large, too small, or in the wrong direction. We will now discuss examples of each type of bias. We will also discuss ways to address these biases when conducting a meta-analysis, including mitigating the biases at the outset through sound meta-analysis design and also assessing the robustness of the ultimate conclusions to possible remaining bias.</p>
<div id="within-study-biases" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.5.1</span> Within-study biases</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it can be useful to directly point the reader to the garbage-in-garbage-out analogy here.<br />
<br />
For example, we could invite the reader to imagine a problematic study. E.g., a within-subject investigation of whether people prefer Meal A or Meal B but does not randomize the order in which people eat the meals. Assuming that the meals are equally tasty but that people are full after eating one meal, we would consistently find that people prefer Meal A (which is eaten first).</p>
<p>If we replicated that biased study 5 times and then put it in a meta-analysis, we would once again likely find that people prefer Meal A. But this is, of course, driven by within-study bias!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within-study biases affect the internal validity of the meta-analyzed studies‚Äô internal validity and include, for example, XXX (Chapter XXX; [use examples of types of bias that were discussed earlier]).</p>
<p>These within-study biases can propagate to the results of the meta-analysis. To mitigate this problem, meta-analysts should try to define study eligibility criteria that reduce within-study biases and, after data have been collected, should qualitatively assess studies‚Äô risks of bias using established rating tools (<span class="citation">Mathur and VanderWeele (<label for="tufte-mn-18" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-18" class="margin-toggle">2022<span class="marginnote">Mathur, Maya B, and Tyler J VanderWeele. 2022. ‚ÄúMethods to Address Confounding and Other Biases in Meta-Analyses: Review and Recommendations.‚Äù <em>Annual Review of Public Health</em>.</span>)</span>).

<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.5.2</span> Applied example</h3>
<p>In Paluck et al.‚Äôs meta-analysis, one way they tried to counteract within-study biases was by only including studies that randomly assigned participants to receive a contact intervention. However, they could have gone a step further by coding for the extent to which, for example, participants may have differentially dropped out of the study. For example, imagine that (a) both a contact intervention and control condition have an equal distribution of prejudice scores and (b) the contact intervention does not significantly impact prejudice. If highly prejudiced people are more likely to drop out of the study when they are in the contact vs.¬†control condition (e.g., because they do not like interacting with a member of a minority group), the mean of the contact intervention will become smaller. In this scenario, researchers may erroneously conclude that the contact intervention reduced depression, despite the fact that the effect can be attributed to differential attrition.</p>

<div id="across-study-biases" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.5.3</span> Across-study biases</h3>
<p>Across-study biases affect the meta-analyzed literature holistically and include, for example, publication bias and selective reporting, as discussed in Chapter XXX. Often, these across-study biases favor statistically significant positive results; in this case, results that survive to publication and inclusion in the meta-analysis will typically have inflated estimates (they are too large compared to the truth) and so result in an inflated meta-analytic estimate.</p>
<p>As in the context of within-study biases, meta-analysts should try to mitigate across-study biases during the design process. That is, meta-analysis inclusion criteria should be designed to cast a broad net, capturing not only high-profile, published studies on the topic, but also studies published in low-profile journals, and ‚Äúgray literature‚Äù such as unpublished dissertations and theses (<span class="citation">Lefebvre et al.

<p>There are also statistical methods to help assess how robust the results may be to across-study biases.

Here is an example of a funnel plot for a hypothetical meta-analysis with no publication bias:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Insert generic funnel plot]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that larger studies (those with smaller standard errors) cluster more closely around the mean than do smaller studies, but large and small studies alike would have point estimates centered around the mean. That is, the funnel plot is symmetric. In contrast, a funnel plot might look asymmetric:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Insert example of asymmetric funnel plot. I think Paluck‚Äôs will work, and it‚Äôs a great example of asymmetry that could reflect substantive differences between large and small studies.]</p>

<p>Here, there appears to be a correlation between studies‚Äô estimates and their standard errors, such that smaller studies tend to have larger estimates than do larger studies.

<li><p>a.) You read the following result in the abstract of a meta-analysis: ‚ÄúIn 83 randomized studies of middle school children, replacing one hour of class time with mindfulness meditation significantly improved standardized test scores (standardized mean difference <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu} = 0.05\)</span>; 95% confidence interval: [<span class="math inline">\(0.01, 0.09\)</span>]; <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;0.05\)</span>).‚Äù Why is this a problematic way to report on meta-analysis results? Suggest a better sentence to replace this one.</p>
<p>b.) You read the rest of the meta-analysis, which concludes with: ‚ÄúThese findings demonstrate robust benefits of meditation for children, suggesting that test scores improve even when the meditation is introduced as a replacement for normal class time.‚Äù You recall that the heterogeneity estimate was <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\tau} = 0.90\)</span>. Do you think that this result regarding the heterogeneity tends to support, or rather tends to undermine, the concluding sentence of the meta-analysis? Why?</p>
<p>c.) What kinds of within-study biases would concern you in this meta-analysis? How might you assess the credibility of the meta-analyzed studies and of the meta-analysis as whole in light of these possible biases?</p></li>
<li><p>You do a meta-analysis on a literature in which statistically significant results in either direction are much more likely to be published that nonsignificant results. Draw the funnel plot you would expect to see. Is the plot symmetric or asymmetric?</p></li>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Quick draft of accident report: Garbage in, garbage out? Meta-analyzing bad research (Coles et al.¬†2019)</p>
<p>You may have heard that Botox can help eliminate wrinkles. But some researchers have also suggested that it may help treat clinical depression when used to paralyze the muscles associated with frowning. As crazy as they may sound, a quick examination of the literature would lead many to conclude that this treatment works. Studies that randomly assign depressed patients to either receive Botox injections or saline injections do indeed find that Botox recipients exhibit decreases in depression. And when you combine all available evidence in a meta-analysis, you find that this difference is quite large: <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu} = 0.83\)</span>, 95% CI [0.52, 1.14].</p>
<p>However, Coles and colleagues (2019) pointed out that there is a problem with within-study bias. Participants are not supposed to know whether they have been randomly assigned to receive Botox or a control saline injections. However, only one of these treatments leads the upper half of your face to be paralyzed, and after a couple of weeks you‚Äôre likely to figure out whether you received the treatment or control injection. Thus, it is possible that the apparent effect of Botox is actually an effect of placebo. The meta-analytic conclusions are potentially undermined by within-study bias.</p>
<p>Coles and colleagues (2019) also found evidence of between-study bias. When coding the effect sizes in the literature, they found that 51% of the outcomes measured were not reported by the study authors. For example, researchers may have collected two measures of depression, but only reported one in the manuscript. This raises concerns about selective reporting: that researchers examining the effects of Botox on depression are only reporting the outcomes that demonstrate an effect, while hiding away the outcomes that do not. In this scenario, any meta-analytic conclusions are potentially undermined by between-study bias.</p>
<p>This is sometimes called the Garbage In, Garbage Out problem in meta-analysis. If within- and between-study bias is not properly mitigated, it is difficult to conclude make valid inferences in a meta-analysis.</p>
