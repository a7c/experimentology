<p>üçé Learning goals:
* Reconceptualize statistical ‚Äútests‚Äù as models of data
* Build intuitions about how specific ‚Äútests‚Äù (e.g., t-tests) relate to more general frameworks (e.g., regression, mixed effects models)
* Identify which models are best suited for which research questions

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Statistics and tea tasting</h2>
<p>[Preamble - Pearson and Fisher and the ‚Äúbritish statistics scene‚Äù (e.g., Galton) all endorsed eugenicist views]</p>
<p>The lady tasting tea experiment:
Ronald Fisher at a party
Intuitive hypotheses: chance vs.¬†tea knowledge.</p>
<p>Discussion question: What do we want to get out of this experiment?
Binary conclusion: context of decision theory?
Estimation of lady‚Äôs sensitivity for individual differences?</p>
<p>Back to the lady.</p>
<p>Discussion question: How many cups should she get right out of 12?</p>
<p>What should we consider:
Too low a standard means we are ‚Äúliberal‚Äù ‚Äì the lady could get lucky
Too high a standard means we need the lady to know a lot!</p>
<p>Define decision-theoretic framework:</p>
<p>Intuitive solution to the lady tasting tea: given the binomial distribution, how likely is her answer by chance?
Excursion: what‚Äôs a probability distribution? A mathematical form to the idea of randomness of a particular type.</p>
<p>If she gets 6, clearly consistent with chance.
If she gets 7, 19% of exactly 7.
But what‚Äôs the probability we care about? 7 OR MORE = 38%
If she gets 8 or more, 19% probability
9 or more, 7% - ARE YOU CONVINCED?
10 or more, 2%</p>
<p>Oh and - how many cups of tea should we taste?
Discussion goal: it depends on how strong we think her tea-tasting sense is!</p>
<p>This is a question about our goals, in particular</p>

<div id="probability-theory-also-known-as-bayes" class="section level2" number="6.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Probability theory (also known as Bayes)</h2>
<p>Bringing back prior knowledge question: how about ESP?
Question: should we as scientists apply such a prior?</p>
<p>Harry potter example</p>
<p>p(h | d) = [p(d | h) p(h)] / [p(d | h) p(h) + p(d | h‚Äô) p(h‚Äô)]</p>
<p>p(h) = .001</p>
<p>p(d | h) = 1</p>
<p>p(h‚Äô) = .999</p>
<p>p(d | h‚Äô) = .0000001</p>
<p>So turn the crank to figure out whether Harry‚Äôs a wizard or no.</p>
<p>Bayesian approaches provide one alternative
Philosophical alternative where probability indexes subjective belief, rather than long-run estimates of probability</p>
<p>We want the probability of the hypothesis given the data.</p>
<p>p(h | d) = p(d | h1) p(h1)
p(d | h1) p(h1) + p(d | h0) p(h0)</p>
<p>P-values only give us the probability of the data given the hypothesis.</p>
<p>So if H1 is very unlikely, low p-value still doesn‚Äôt mean we should change our belief.</p>
<p>ESP example (Wagenmakers et al.¬†2011):
Assume p(h1) is 10x-20:</p>
<p>P &lt; .05 provides almost no evidence!</p>
<p>So you need to apply the priors to get the kind of inferences you want.</p>

<div id="frequentist-inference" class="section level2" number="6.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Frequentist inference</h2>
<p>Philosophy
Bayes: Data are the data, what can we infer? (subjective)
Frequentist: Do the same thing again and again, what happens (objective truth)
Prior information
Bayes theorem
‚ÄúData fixed‚Äù vs.¬†‚Äúmodel fixed‚Äù</p>
<p>Bayesians don‚Äôt have to care about optional stopping</p>
<p>Differences in philosophy
Bayesian stats are good for:
Cases where you have a lot of prior knowledge
E.g., statistics for voter prediction in elections
Cases where you want to deal with uncertainty in a principled way
E.g., integrating knowledge about measurement error into your model
Null models
Cases where you want to decide in favor of null
(though you can do this in frequentist perspectives)
Small N data
Many frequentist tests are based on guarantees in the limit. Guarantees don‚Äôt hold at N=3 or 5 or even 10.
Frequentist good for:
Decision theory (cf.¬†bayesian decision theory)
Absence of assumptions (‚Äúmore objective‚Äù)
Often easier to state and solve models</p>

<p>Despite all these reasons to be worried about p-values, for many practicing scientists (at least at time of writing) there is no right answer. Even if we‚Äôd like to be Bayesian all the time because the paradigm makes philosophical and practical sense, there are a number of obstacles. First, though tools like <code>Stan</code>, <code>BayesFactor</code>, and <code>brms</code> make fitting Bayesian models easier (more about this below and in the next chapter), it‚Äôs still on average quite a bit harder to fit a Bayesian model than it is a frequentist one. Second, because Bayesian analyses are less familiar, it may be an uphill battle to convince advisors, reviewers, and funders to use them. So as a group, we are still mostly Bayesian when we can be ‚Äì and frequentist when it‚Äôs not practical. One reason we don‚Äôt feel so bad about this stance is that, a lot of them time we‚Äôre not so worried about making binary inferences, whether they are at <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .05\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(BF &gt; 3\)</span> or whatever the threshold is.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Making models: Inference vs estimation</h2>
<p>Throughout this book we‚Äôve taken the position that the goal of experiments is to estimate a causal effect of interest, ideally as part of some theory of how different constructs relate to one another. All this talk of hypotheses and inferences above is only indirectly related to that goal.</p>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Accident report: Once you have the basic t-test under your belt, it might feel natural to compare each group to 0 and conclude that one group is different from 0 and the other one isn‚Äôt.
