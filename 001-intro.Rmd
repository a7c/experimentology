üçé Learning goals: Define ‚Äúexperiment‚Äùand ‚Äútheory‚Äù, distinguish between bias and precision, reason about the relationship between the experimental method and causal inference, and analyze features of an experiment that can lead to weaker or stronger tests of theory.

What is an experiment and why do one? 

- On one hand, experiments are ‚Äúthe worst way to learn about the world‚Äù (in the words of one of our mentors). ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt play 20 questions with nature and win‚Äù (Newell 1973). But experiments are also one of our best tools for making strong causal inferences about the hidden structure of the world. They allow us to not just observe the world but to systematically intervene on it.
- We used to just poke things or people and measure what happened (see Hacking, 1990 on the 19th century craze of just measuring everything for fun.) Now we typically want our experiments to resolve deeper questions or test hypotheses.
- Causal graphical models as an approach to understanding causal inference via counterfactuals (Pearl and Mackenzie 2018).

What is a theory? 

Theories aim to predict and to explain, but there is some tension between these. Theories with high predictive value are not necessarily causal or parsimonious (e.g., a black-box neural network model that predicts heart disease risk). Meanwhile, theories with high explanatory value may only account for a small proportion of overall variance in a behavior (e.g. a theory of lexical priming that introduces a new, causal role of accessibility.)	

::: {.ethics-box}
üåø Ethics box: Who are we theorizing about? How does this theory build on prior history? And what are the consequences of that theorizing? Example: the input-uptake relationship in language learning is a well-supported idea, but it can become weaponized against communities of color (Sperry, Sperry, and Miller 2019).

How to do experiments that help build theory?

- Introducing the concepts of precision and bias (dartboard analogy).
    - Precision of measurement is a foundational value allowing for cumulative progress and falsification; measuring null effects with precision can be just as important.
    - Precise measurements must also be unbiased to be helpful in theory construction ‚Äì or else theories risk reifying bias into their constructs.
- "Risky tests" (Meehl 1978) vs. "flexible theories" (Roberts and Pashler 2000)
    - Formal relationship to Bayes Occam‚Äôs Razor and example of spreading bets across every horse vs. placing all your money on one horse (if that one horse wins, you get a much higher payoff in the second case).
- Each experiment can be viewed as a single operationalization of an underlying theory, thus the value of meta-analysis to pool across these instantiations (see Chapter 16).
