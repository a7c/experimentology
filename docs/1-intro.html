<p>Welcome to Experimentology. This is a book about how to do psychology experiments! Much of what we cover in the book is about the nitty gritty of how to design your study, how to analyze your data, or even how to name your files! But before we can get into all that, we‚Äôre going to need to have a conversation about what an experiment is. And that in turn will lead us pretty quickly to talk about <strong>causality</strong>, since the unique contribution of experiments is to help us measure causal effects. That‚Äôs the first part of this chapter.</p>
<p>The second part of this chapter is about theory building, which is often one of the broader goals of doing an experiment. Sometimes you just want to see what happens, like a kid knocking down a tower. And sometimes you want to know the answer to a specific applied question, like ‚Äúwill taking one midterms vs.¬†weekly quizzes lead students in a class to perform better on the final.‚Äù But more often, our goal is to create psychological theories that help us explain and predict new observations. Thus, the second half of this chapter will be about theories.</p>
<p>Having discussed experiments and theories, we will then be in a position to talk a bit about what positions an experiment well to contribute to theory, our last topic. But, as we‚Äôll do in most chapters in the book, we‚Äôll begin with a concrete example of theory building in psychology.</p>

<div class="case-study">
<p>üî¨ Case study: Generalization, similarity, and Bayesian inference</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs play a number game. Imagine I give you the number 16, and ask you how similar other numbers are to that one. You‚Äôll probably agree that 32 is more similar than 33. Is 96 more similar than 94? How about 6 vs.¬†8? Perhaps surprisingly, people‚Äôs judgments on such problems are quite systematic <span class="citation">(<label for="tufte-mn-4" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-4" class="margin-toggle">Tenenbaum 2000<span class="marginnote">Tenenbaum, Joshua B. 2000. <span>‚ÄúRules and Similarity in Concept Learning.‚Äù</span> <em>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems</em> 12: 59‚Äì65.</span>)</span>: the more ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù that two numbers share, the more similar they are judged to be. Not only is 32 even like 16, it‚Äôs also a power of 2, and divisible by 8; in contrast, 33 shares none of these features.</p>
<p>Predicting arbitrary similarities of this sort is one of the hardest problems of psychology, and is liked to one of the biggest challenges for organisms: generalization. How do you take what you know and apply it to a new situation? One answer is that you use the same answer that has worked in similar situations ‚Äì but to do this kind of extrapolation, you need a notion of similarity.</p>
<p>Early learning theorists were obsessed with these issues of similarity and generalization because their view was that organisms (humans being no exception) learned conditioned associations with specific stimuli and then generalized from these associations to determine their response to new situations. So an animal conditioned to salivate to a tone of a particular frequency might salivate slightly less to a tone that was close in pitch, and salivate substantially less or not at all to a tone that was further away.</p>
<p>Roger Shepard worked for much of his career on understanding this problem of similarity and generalization, culminating in what he called the ‚Äúuniversal law of generalization,‚Äù which allowed generalizations to be derived in a wide range of stimulus spaces <span class="citation">(<label for="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle">Shepard 1987<span class="marginnote">Shepard, Roger N. 1987. <span>‚ÄúToward a Universal Law of Generalization for Psychological Science.‚Äù</span> <em>Science</em> 237 (4820): 1317‚Äì23.</span>)</span>. The first step in this process was establishing a stimulus space. For a stimulus domain like size, color, or even speech sounds, he used a procedure called ‚Äúmulti-dimensional scaling‚Äù to infer how stimulus items could be placed in a low-dimensional (often 2D) cartesian space. Then, when he visualized generalization gradients within this space, he found the incredibly consistent pattern shown in Figure <a href="1-intro.html#fig:shepard">1.1</a>. Working backwards from this pattern, he was able to establish a derivation for this exponential generalization gradient that allowed him to claim it as a universal law.</p>

</p>
<p>The pattern shown in Shepard‚Äôs work is an example of <strong>inductive theory building</strong>. In the vocabulary we‚Äôre developing, Shepard ran (or obtained the data from) <strong>randomized experiments</strong> in which the <strong>manipulation</strong> was stimulus dimension (e.g., circle size) and the <strong>measure</strong> was an explicit similarity judgment (e.g., how similar is this circle to that one). Then the theory that Shepard proposes links three <strong>constructs</strong> ‚Äì latent entities whose relationships the theory specifies. In particular, 1) similarity is used to derive 2) an internal psychological space, and 3) generalizations are then derived from distance in this space.<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> If you have some background in the study of science, you may be ready to call the philosophy of science police! If you‚Äôre feeling that way, just wait ‚Äì we‚Äôll try to link some of our ideas to at least a lay understanding of the philosophy of science literature!</span></p>
<p>Could it be that the ‚Äúnumber game‚Äù judgments above are the same kinds of generalizations that Shepard observed in his analyses of perceptual data? <span class="citation"><label for="tufte-mn-6" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-6" class="margin-toggle">Tenenbaum and Griffiths (2001)<span class="marginnote">Tenenbaum, Joshua B, and Thomas L Griffiths. 2001. <span>‚ÄúGeneralization, Similarity, and Bayesian Inference.‚Äù</span> <em>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</em> 24 (4): 629‚Äì40.</span></span> presented a theory of similarity that preserved almost all of Shepard‚Äôs assumptions, but did not require a continuous metric space at all. In its simplest form, the model just stated that the strength of a generalization was proportional to its specificity. This simplification allowed the model to be used to compute similarity and generalization for arbitrary domains, even the features of whole numbers! So for example, the property of being even does not confer much similarity because it is shared by half of all whole numbers; in contrast, being a power of 2 conveys much more because it is rarer. When applied to the number game, this model produced a close correspondence with human judgments.</p>
<p>Since the development of this generalization model, it has been applied to a wide variety of domains including word learning <span class="citation">(<label for="tufte-mn-7" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-7" class="margin-toggle">Xu and Tenenbaum 2007<span class="marginnote">Xu, Fei, and Joshua B Tenenbaum. 2007. <span>‚ÄúWord Learning as Bayesian Inference.‚Äù</span> <em>Psychological Review</em> 114 (2): 245.</span>)</span>, object exploration <span class="citation">(<label for="tufte-mn-8" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-8" class="margin-toggle">Gweon, Tenenbaum, and Schulz 2010<span class="marginnote">Gweon, Hyowon, Joshua B Tenenbaum, and Laura E Schulz. 2010. <span>‚ÄúInfants Consider Both the Sample and the Sampling Process in Inductive Generalization.‚Äù</span> <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> 107 (20): 9066‚Äì71.</span>)</span>, and sequential rule learning <span class="citation">(<label for="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle">Frank and Tenenbaum 2011<span class="marginnote">Frank, Michael C, and Joshua B Tenenbaum. 2011. <span>‚ÄúThree Ideal Observer Models for Rule Learning in Simple Languages.‚Äù</span> <em>Cognition</em> 120 (3): 360‚Äì71.</span>)</span>. Yet this models has been critiqued as psychologically implausible <span class="citation">(<label for="tufte-mn-10" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-10" class="margin-toggle">Endress 2013<span class="marginnote">Endress, Ansgar D. 2013. <span>‚ÄúBayesian Learning and the Psychology of Rule Induction.‚Äù</span> <em>Cognition</em> 127 (2): 159‚Äì76.</span>)</span>, since it requires people to know a priori how specific a particular features is. Further, the general framework within it which the model was posed has been critiqued extensively for its assumption that human reasoning conforms to optimal statistical computations <span class="citation">(<label for="tufte-mn-11" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-11" class="margin-toggle">Jones and Love 2011<span class="marginnote">Jones, Matt, and Bradley C Love. 2011. <span>‚ÄúBayesian Fundamentalism or Enlightenment? On the Explanatory Status and Theoretical Contributions of Bayesian Models of Cognition.‚Äù</span> <em>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</em> 34 (4): 169.</span>)</span>. One way of thinking about these critiques is that they question which phenomena are in the scope of the theory: and in particular, whether Bayesian models should explain human psychological processes, or whether they are just a descriptive account of certain average behavioral outcomes.</p>
<p>In our discussion below, we‚Äôll look at the broader goal of theory building and how this kind of critique echoes some of the main tensions around what theories are for and how theories can be evaluated. Shepard wrote in the conclusion of his 1987 paper, ‚ÄúPossibly, behind the diverse behaviors of humans and animals, as behind the various motions of planets and stars, we may discern the operation of universal laws.‚Äù While Shepard‚Äôs dream is an ambitious one, it defines one potential ideal for psychological theorizing.</p>

<p>In brief</p>

<li>On one hand, experiments are ‚Äúthe worst way to learn about the world‚Äù (in the words of one of our mentors). ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt play 20 questions with nature and win‚Äù (Newell 1973). But experiments are also one of our best tools for making strong causal inferences about the hidden structure of the world. They allow us to not just observe the world but to systematically intervene on it.</li>
<li>We used to just poke things or people and measure what happened (see Hacking, 1990 on the 19th century craze of just measuring everything for fun.) Now we typically want our experiments to resolve deeper questions or test hypotheses.</li>

<div id="causal-inference" class="section level3" number="1.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Causal inference</h3>
<ul>
<li>Causal graphical models as an approach to understanding causal inference via counterfactuals (Pearl and Mackenzie 2018).</li>
</ul>
<p>Every year, one of the trickiest concepts for me to teach in my experimental methods course is the difference between experimental confounds and covariates. Although this distinction seems simple, it‚Äôs pretty deeply related to the definition of what an experiment is and why experiments lead to good causal inferences. It‚Äôs also caught up in a number of methodological problems that come up again and again in my class. This post is my attempt to explain the distinction and how it relates to different problems and cultural practices in psychology.</p>
<p>Throughout this post, I‚Äôll use a silly example. My first year of graduate school, I got distracted from my actual research by the hypothesis that listening to music with lyrics decreased my ability to write papers for my classes. I‚Äôll call this the ‚ÄúBob Dylan‚Äù hypothesis, since I was listening to a lot of Dylan at the time. Let‚Äôs represent this by the following causal diagram.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-13" class="margin-toggle">‚äï</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-13" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;"><img src="images/dylan1.png"/></span></span></p>
<p>Our outcome is writing skill (Y) and our predictor is Dylan listening (X). The edge between them represents a hypothesized causal relationship. Dylan is hypothesized to affect writing skill, and not vice versa. (These kinds of diagrams are called causal graphical models*).</p>
<p>Suppose we did an observational study where we measured each of these variables in a large population. Assume we came up with some way to sample people‚Äôs writing, get a measure of whether they either were or weren‚Äôt listening to lyric-heavy music at the time, and assess the writing sample‚Äôs quality. We might find that Y was correlated with X, but in a surprising direction: listening to Dylan would be related to better writing.</p>
<p>Can we make a causal inference in this case? If so, we could get rich promoting a Dylan-based writing intervention. Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt ‚Äì correlation doesn‚Äôt equal causation here, because there is (at least one) confounding third variable: age (Z). Age is positively related to both Dylan listening and writing skill in our population of interest. Older people tend to be good writers and also tend to be more into folk rockers; I‚Äôm not even going to put a question mark on this edge because I‚Äôm pretty sure this is true.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-14" class="margin-toggle">‚äï</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-14" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;"><img src="images/dylan2.png"/></span></span></p>
<p>But: the causal relationship of age to our other two variables means that variation in Z can induce a correlation in X and Y, even in the absence of a true causal link. We can say that age is a confound in estimating the Dylan-writing skill relationship: it‚Äôs a variable that is correlated with both our predictor and our outcome variables.</p>
<p>To get gold-standard evidence about causality, we need to do an experiment. (We won‚Äôt discuss statistical techniques for inferring causality, which can be useful but don‚Äôt give you gold standard evidence anyway; review here).</p>
<p>Experiments are when we intervene on the world and measure the consequences. Here, this means forcing some people to listen to Dylan. In the language of graphical models, if we control the Dylan listening, that means that variable X is causally exogenous. (Exogenous means that it‚Äôs not caused by anything else in the system). We ‚Äúsnipped‚Äù the causal link between age and Dylan listening.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-15" class="margin-toggle">‚äï</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-15" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;"><img src="images/dylan3.png"/></span></span></p>
<p>So now we can ‚Äúwiggle‚Äù the Dylan listening variable ‚Äì change it experimentally ‚Äì and see if we detect any changes in writing skill. We do this by randomly assigning individuals to listen to Dylan or not and then measuring writing during the assigned listening (or non-listening) period. This is a ‚Äúbetween-subjects‚Äù design. We can use our randomized experiment to get a measure of the average treatment effect of Dylan, the size of the causal effect of the intervention on the outcome.</p>
<!-- In this simple experiment, the ATE is estimated by the regression Y ~ X (for ease of exposition, I'm not going to discuss so-called mixed models, which model variation across subjects and/or experimental items). That's the elegant logic of randomized experiments: the difference between condition gives you the average effect. -->

HISTORY OF THE TERM?</span> Constructs are hypothesized abstract entities, which can range widely in specificity. g (general intelligence) is the classic psychological example of a broad construct. In contrast, an example of a very specific construct is <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the ‚Äúrationality‚Äù parameter in RSA models that controls how greedily RSA agents choose the higher-probability choice.<label for="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">4</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">4</span> A tradition of research in cognitive science posits that human knowledge is organized into theories <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gopnikwellman" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>gopnikwellman?</strong></a>)</span>, and that in particular we organize our knowledge about other people into an <strong>intuitive theory of psychology</strong>. This intuitive theory includes concepts like ‚Äúbelief,‚Äù ‚Äúdesire,‚Äù and ‚Äúemotion‚Äù <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wellmanXYZ" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>wellmanXYZ?</strong></a>)</span>, but it‚Äôs important to distinguish the constructs we posit in psychological theories from the terms in our intuitive theories. Often one is grounded in the other, but the failure to distinguish the two can lead to sloppy reasoning..</span></p>
<p>Theories then are groups of assumptions about the relationships between these constructs. Occasionally, defining a construct is enough to describe a theory. Defining general intelligence as g, the shared variance between different tests of intelligence, is itself a theoretically-loaded move [critique of IQ here? maybe cite Shalizi]. But more frequently the constructs don‚Äôt mean anything by themselves (think about <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> in RSA!) ‚Äì they gain their meaning by their relationship to other constructs.</p>
<p>This web of constructs and assumptions is what <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cronbach1958" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>cronbach1958?</strong></a>)</span> referred to as a ‚Äúnomological network‚Äù ‚Äì a set of proposals about how different entities are connected to one another. (We‚Äôll return to this idea in Chapter <a href="7-measurement.html#measurement">7</a> when we talk about measurement validity). Calling the theory a ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù sounds like it‚Äôs a <strong>structural equation model</strong> (SEM) where there are circles and lines and the lines represent something akin to the correlations between the numbers in the circles. That‚Äôs one way to define a psychological theory, but it‚Äôs not the only way!</p>
<p>There are many different frameworks for describing psychological constructs and their relationships. SEM is just one framework, built on linear regression. But the probabilistic modeling framework used in RSA is another such framework, where a system of equations defines a conditional probability distribution <span class="citation">(<label for="tufte-mn-16" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-16" class="margin-toggle">N. D. Goodman, Tenenbaum, and Contributors 2016<span class="marginnote">Goodman, Noah D, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, and The ProbMods Contributors. 2016. <span>‚Äú<span class="nocase">Probabilistic Models of Cognition</span>.‚Äù</span> <a href="http://probmods.org/v2">http://probmods.org/v2</a>.</span>)</span>. Other computational frameworks from procedural models like ACT-R <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-anderson" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>anderson?</strong></a>)</span> to connectionist models <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rethinkinginnateness" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>rethinkinginnateness?</strong></a>)</span> and modern neural networks <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-naturereviewbengio" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>naturereviewbengio?</strong></a>)</span> provide other frameworks.</p>
<p>None of these computational or formal artifacts are themselves psychological theories, but all of them can be used to create psychological theories via the mapping of constructs onto entities in the model and the use of the principles of the formalism to instantiate psychological hypotheses or assumptions.<label for="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">5</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">5</span> We might also want to add to the theory some assumptions about how these constructs ground out into measurements. Some philosophers of science distinguish between the ‚Äúcore‚Äù assumptions of a theory and the ‚Äúperiphery‚Äù ‚Äì and we might be tempted to say that specific measurements are peripheral. If we came up with a better measure of the construct, or it turned out that our measure wasn‚Äôt particularly good, we could replace it without too much damage to the underlying theory.</span></p>
<p>Theories can then be tested via their ability to explain existing patterns of data and to predict new data. There is some tension between these. Theories with high predictive value are not necessarily causal or parsimonious (e.g., a black-box neural network model that predicts heart disease risk). Meanwhile, theories with high explanatory value may only account for a small proportion of overall variance in a behavior (e.g.¬†a theory of lexical priming that introduces a new, causal role of accessibility).</p>
