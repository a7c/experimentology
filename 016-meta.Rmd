## Introduction?

In a widely-cited study on the power of describing social norms, Goldstein, Cialdini, and Griskevicius (2008) gave one group of hotel guests a message that encouraged them to reuse their towels and another group of hotel guests a message that indicated that most other guests reused their towels. Across two studies, they found that guests who received the social norm message were more likely to reuse their towels than guests who received the control message (Study 1 *p* = .05, Study 2 *p* = .03). Five later replications, though, all failed to find significant evidence of increases in towel reuse amongst guests receiving the social norm message (all *p*s \> .05).

At first glance, you may be enticed to conclude that the effect of social norm messages does not reliably impact towel reuse. You may even go a step further and try to think of explanations for why one team found the effect, but the other did not. (Maybe the messages change behavior when guest receive nice fluffy towels, but doesn't work when guests receive sets of crappy towels.) Or, if you're a practitioner of experimentology, you may ask yourselves whether these findings are really all that different. You may even be so bold to do a meta-analysis!

If you did the latter, you would find that the results across these studies are, for the most part, quite consistent. Guests in four out of five of the studies were more likely to reuse their towels after receiving social norm messages, but the difference was not large enough in any one study to confidently conclude that this difference was larger than zero. When the results were statistically combined in a meta-analysis, Scheibehenne, Jamil, and Wagenmakers (2016) found that social norm messages *on average* do increase hotel towel reuse.

It's not magic--it's just meta-analysis! In this chapter, you'll learn more about this useful technique.

Notes to Maya: Scheibehenne et al. did not estimate heterogeneity, so I do not know how consistent these results actually are. One of the studies did actually yield a sizeable oppostite-direction effect, so I'm not really sure if their fixed-effect assumption is reasonable. (Note, this was a commentary and tutorial about Bayesian meta-analysis, not an actual meta-analysis. So some of the methodological details are somewhat weak.) We may want to look into a scenario where (a) a fixed effect meta-analysis is better justified, (b) the direction of the effects is consistent across studies, but (c) the statistical significance of the effects is not consistent across studies.

What distinguishes meta-analysis from other types of reviews? Literature review typology, organized by your search, appraisal, synthesis, and analysis strategy (Grant and Booth 2009).

When many students hear the term "review," they probably have flashbacks to a time where they threw some search term into Google Scholar, downloaded a bunch of articles that looked interesting, spent a few hours reading those articles, and then wrote a summary of what has been learned from these studies. There's not necessarily anything wrong with this approach, but there are a few things that can be additionally learned from doing a meta-analysis.

Meta-analysis is a statistical technique for combining results from multiple studies.

In addition to reading articles, a researcher performing a meta-analysis would also extract information about the *effect size*.

After this information has been extracted, the researcher would perform an analysis where these effect sizes are combined in a single set of analyses. By combining information from multiple studies, the researcher can make a more precise estimate of the size of some effect. The researcher can also look at the extent to which this effect varies across studies. They may even them perform analyses indicating whether studies with certain characteristics systematically produce different results.

Think about how meta-analysis might give you a different impression of an area of study than a literature review. If you would have performed a literature review on studies examining the effect of social norm messaging on hotel towel re-use, you would have likely come away with the impression that there is an unreliable effect at best and no effect at worst. However, when statistically combining the results of these studies, a meta-analyst is able to see that the findings are more consistent than they appear at first glance--and that, when considering all the available evidence, it actually appears that social norm messaging does decrease hotel towel reuse. Considering that, for example, there were 1.7 billion overnight hotel bookings in the European Union alone in 2013 (Eurostat, 2015), the difference in the types of the conclusions formed by a literature review and a meta-analysis matter quite a bit!

## Running example: The contact hypothesis

[Introduce the applied example]


## Intuitive, but problematic, approaches to evidence synthesis

We have seen why it is important to synthesize evidence across studies on the same topic rather than just focus on one study at a time. How should we actually do this in practice? What most of us do intuitively in this situation is simply to count how many studies supported the hypothesis under investigation, versus how many did not support the hypothesis. Indeed, many narrative reviews take essentially this approach as well. Such a count usually amounts to counting the number of studies with "significant" $p$-values, since (for better or for worse) "significance" is largely what drives studies' take-home conclusions (@mcshane2017statistical; @nelson1986interpretation). This is called "*vote-counting*" (@borenstein2021introduction). For example, in Paluck et al.'s meta-analysis on the contact hypothesis, 11/27 (EYEBALLED) studies were significant, all with positive point estimates. So, based on this vote-count, we would have the impression that most studies do not support the contact hypothesis. 

Despite its intuitive appeal, vote-counting can be very misleading. First, this approach characterizes evidence solely in terms of dichotomized p-values, while entirely ignoring effect sizes; this is the very same fetishism of statistical "significance" that we introduced in [Chapter \@ref(replication) on replication] and is subject to all the same limitations. In the context of evidence synthesis, it could be the case that relatively few studies are "significant" (for example, in a literature of typically small studies), yet if the studies typically have large point estimates, then the consensus of evidence could actually be quite strong. Or inversely, it could be that nearly all studies are "significant", but if they typically have small point estimates, then the consensus of evidence might still be rather weak. In these cases, vote-counting could lead us badly astray.

To avoid these pitfalls, our evidence synthesis needs to account for effect sizes themselves. How about if we just average the studies' estimates? For example, in Paluck et al.'s meta-analysis, the mean of the studies' estimates was XXX. This approach is perhaps a step in the right direction, but still has some important limitations. In particular, this approach gives equal weight to each study, such that a small study (like Hull et al., with a sample size of XXX [note: this had the second-smallest RE weight]) contributes as much to the mean effect size as a large study (like Boisjoly et al., with a sample size of XXX [note: this had the highest RE weight]). That doesn't make sense: larger studies should clearly carry more weight in the analysis. This brings us to our first principled approach to meta-analysis, namely fixed-effects meta-analysis.

## Fixed-effects meta-analysis

Fixed-effects meta-analysis is a simple way to average studies' estimates while giving more weight to larger studies. Specifically, fixed-effects meta-analysis is a weighted average of estimates in which each study's estimate is weighted by its inverse-variance (i.e., the inverse of its squared standard error). This makes sense because larger, more precise studies have smaller variances, so they should get more weight in the analysis. Specifically the fixed-effects pooled estimate is: 

$$\widehat{\mu} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \widehat{\theta}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^k w_i}$$
where $k$ is the number of studies, $\widehat{\theta}_i$ is the point estimate of the $i^{th}$ study, and $w_i = 1/\widehat{\sigma}^2_i$ is study $i$'s weight in the analysis (i.e., the inverse of its variance). 

[Do we want to show the SE for $\widehat{\mu}$?]

### Applied example

In Paluck et al.'s meta-analysis, we would calculate this as:

>[SHOW ARITHMETIC FOR THE FIRST FEW STUDIES]. 

We thus estimate that the effect size in this studies is a standardized mean difference of $\widehat{\mu} = XXX$; 95\% confidence interval: [XXX]; $p=$XXX. That is, we estimated that intergroup contact was associated with a decrease in prejudice of XXX standard deviations.

### Limitations of fixed-effects meta-analysis

Fixed-effects meta-analysis does have an important limitation. To see the problem intuitively, imagine we actually had the full dataset of individual observations from each study. (This is what meta-analysts dream of, but it's rarely feasible in practice.) Fixed-effects meta-analysis is like simply concatenating all the studies' datasets and then calculating the effect size, ignoring that observations came from different studies. 

But what if the studies differ from one another? For example, in Paluck et al.'s meta-analysis, many design elements differed in ways that could make the interventions more or less effective in different studies: some studies recruited adult participants while others recruited children, some studies considered contact between participants of different races while others considered contact between participants of different ages, and so on. This means that the contact effect could actually differ across studies: the effects could be *heterogeneous*.

Does this presence of heterogeneity remind you of anything from when we analyzed repeated-measures data in [Chapter XXX]? Recall that, with repeated-measures data, there can be heterogeneity across participants, and we dealt with this by introducing random intercepts by participant to our regression model. We can do much the same thing in meta-analysis; let's turn to this now.


## Random-effects meta-analysis

Whereas fixed-effects meta-analysis essentially postulates that all studies in the meta-analysis have the same population effect size, $\mu$, random-effects meta-analysis instead postulates that studies' population effects come from a normal distribution^[Technically, other specifications of random-effects meta-analysis are possible. For example, robust variance estimation does not require making assumptions about the distribution of effects across studies (@hedges2010robust).] with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\tau$. The larger the standard deviation $\tau$, the more heterogeneous the effects are across studies. A random-effects model then tries to estimate both $\mu$ and $\tau$, for example by maximum likelihood (@dersimonian1986meta; @brockwell2001comparison).  

In practice, the estimate $\widehat{\mu}$ is still a weighted average of studies' estimates, as for fixed-effects meta-analysis:

$$\widehat{\mu} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \widehat{\theta}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^k w_i}$$
but the inverse-variance weights now incorporate the heterogeneity as well: $w_i = 1/\left(\widehat{\tau}^2 + \widehat{\sigma}^2_i \right)$. These weights represent the inverse of studies' *marginal* variances, comprising not only statistical error due to their finite sample sizes ($\widehat{\sigma}^2_i$) but also genuine effect heterogeneity ($\widehat{\tau}^2$).^[The estimate of $\widehat{\tau}^2$ is a bit more complicated, but is essentially a weighted average of studies' residuals, $\widehat{\theta_i} - \widehat{\mu}$, while subtracting away variation due to statistical error, $\widehat{\sigma}^2_i$ (@dersimonian1986meta; @brockwell2001comparison).]

The upshot is that small studies contribute more strongly to a random-effects meta-analysis than to a fixed-effects meta-analysis.^[Extra credit: Can you see why this is true mathematically?] Additionally, confidence intervals are typically wider in random-effects meta-analysis than in fixed-effects meta-analysis; heuristically, this is because random-effects meta-analysis has to draw inference to a distribution of heterogeneous effects.


### Reporting on heterogeneity

Remember that in random-effects meta-analysis, the estimate $\widehat{\mu}$ represents only the *mean* population effect across studies. It tells us nothing about the heterogeneity. In practice, we would recommend always reporting the heterogeneity estimate $\widehat{\tau}$ as well, perhaps supplemented by other related metrics (@riley2011interpretation, @wang2019simple, @mathur_mam). Reporting on the heterogeneity can help indicate how consistent or inconsistent the effects are across studies, which may point to the need to investigate moderators of the effect.^[For example, one approach to investigate moderators in meta-analysis is meta-regression, in which moderators (e.g., type of intergroup contact) are included as covariates in a random-effects meta-analysis model. As in standard regression, coefficients can then be estimated for each moderator, representing the mean difference in population effect between studies with versus without the moderator.]  


### Applied example

Conducting a random-effects meta-analysis of Paluck et al.'s dataset yields $\widehat{\mu} = XXX$; 95\% confidence interval: [XXX]; $p=$XXX. That is, we estimated that, *on average across studies*, intergroup contact was associated with a decrease in prejudice of XXX standard deviations. Additionally, we estimated that the standard deviation of population effects was $\widehat{\tau}=XXX$; 95\% confidence interval: [XXX].
