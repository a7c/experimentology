# Visualization {#viz}

::: {.learning-goals}
üçé Learning goals: Analyze and compare visualizations using principles of visualization; learn to make ‚Äúthe design plot‚Äù showing raw data relative to the critical design inferences of the experiment; select different visualizations of variability and distribution; connect these concepts to measurement principles.

::: {.case-study}
üî¨ Case study: Sklar et al. (2012) reported evidence of ‚Äúunconscious‚Äù arithmetic. Further reanalyses didn‚Äôt support this finding (Moors and Hesselmann 2018). Rabagliati et al. (2018) also failed to replicate. Visualizations provide a framework for asking about the ways the measurements relate to the manipulation that might have shed light on the issues.

Basic principles of visualization. This book will not provide a full treatment of visualizations, but we discuss some basic guidelines. (Tutorial for data manipulation and visualizations in Appendices C and D).

- Statistical visualization vs. infoviz (Gelman and Unwin 2013)
- ‚ÄúFix the axis labels‚Äù
- Principles:
    - Show the design (see below for the ‚Äúdata plot‚Äù): make sure that the variables you manipulate are visible in your plots
    - Facilitate comparison: make sure that the contrasts you want to interpret are highlighted visually
    - Maximize information, minimize ink: following Tufte, use the simplest possible presentation of the maximal amount of information.

Exploratory visualization

- The critical importance of visualizing the data distribution (histograms). 
- Mapping ‚Äúvisual variables‚Äù (size, color, etc.) to the critical variables in your design


::: {.accident-report}
‚ö†Ô∏è Accident report: [Distributional] gorillas in the midst: Many data analysts don‚Äôt bother checking whether they are violating distribution assumptions. If they did, they‚Äôd sometimes realize there is a gorilla in the midst (Yanai and Lercher 2020).

Confirmatory visualization (including ‚ÄúThe design plot‚Äù)

- How to make a plot that maps onto the key, pre-registered analyses
- Different levels of specificity for different audiences 

Visualizing variability

- Measures of precision: confidence intervals and how to extract them from our statistical models.

::: {.interactive}
‚å®Ô∏è Interactive box: bootstrapping for confidence intervals, a nice generic method for getting some sense of precision. But be careful: there are many common abuses of the bootstrap, for example to obtain inference in small samples.
