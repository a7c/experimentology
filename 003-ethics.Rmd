## Ethical Frameworks

<p> Introduction </p>

### The Deontological Approach
<p> If you were ever instructed as a child to "respect your elders", congratulations! You have been introduced to **deontological ethics**. Also known as duty-based ethics, deontology emphasizes the importance of morality in deed, regardless of the outcome [@Biagetti2020]. 16th century philosopher and Deontology's most cited figure, Immanuel Kant, believed that there exists universal moral laws everyone must obey, and that following these laws elevates us to rational agents. For example, The Ten Commandments, a biblical account in which the Jewish God (? is this the right way to word this) instructed his servant, Moses, to write down ten rules for the Israelite (? Israelite in the Bible, but better to say Israelis?) people to obey, is a prime example of deontological ethics   **[@English Standard Version Bible. (2001). ESV Online. https://esv.literalword.com/]**. Commands such as "Thou shalt not steal" and "Thou shalt not kill" offered clear instructions for the Israelite people to obey. To Kant, deontology provided a means of establishing order without the confusion of evaluating individual outcomes. This line of thinking is akin to prioritizing "intent" over "impact." It is important to remember that deontological ethics is unconcerned with individual needs, wants, desires, and goals, which means that morality is a function of both duty and action. Thinking back to our initial example that opened this paragraph, if we asked why we needed to respect our elders, we may have been told it was "the right thing to do." </p>
<p> This approach to ethics works well until it doesn't. Imagine the elder you were instructed as a child to respect says that people who don't wear seat belts should not receive medical attention if they are involved in an auto accident. What's more, he asks you to help hand out flyers for his next protest. Suddenly, you are faced with incompatible goals; although you have learned to respect your elders, you also believe that people who are involved in auto accidents deserve medical attention, regardless of whether or not they were wearing a seatbelt at the time of impact. Deontological ethics deals only in absolutist terms, meaning that there exists one set of standards to follow and that there can be no gray area. Deontology cannot solve your complicated moral dilemma, and you are no closer to arriving at a solution. </p>
