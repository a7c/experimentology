We've been arguing that experiments are about measuring effects. You might ask then, why does this book even need a chapter about statistical inference? Why can't we just report our measurements and be done? 

Statistical inference is critical to experimental methods because experiments -- especially experiments with human participants -- tend to yield noisy and variable data. Statistical methods allow us to make sense of the data and ask critical questions of it, like:

1. How likely is it that this pattern of measurements was produced by chance variation? 
2. Do these data provide more support for one hypothesis or another? 
3. How big is the effect of a manipulation, and how precise is our estimate of that effect?
4. What portion of the variation in the data is due to a particular manipulation (as opposed to variation between participants, stimulus items, or other manipulations)?

Question (1) is associated with one particular type of statistical testing -- **null hypothesis significance testing** (NHST) in the **frequentist** statistical tradition. NHST has become synonymous with data analysis. This equivalence has been to the detriment of both data analysis and statistics more generally. The instinct to "go test your data for significance" before visualizing your data and trying to understand how it relates to the various sources of variation in your design (participants, items, manipulations, etc.) is in our view one of the most unhelpful things an experimenter can do. $p < .05$ or not, a test of this sort gives you literally *one bit*^[In the information theoretic sense, as well as the common sense!] of information about your data. The kinds of visualizations we advocate in Chapter \@ref(viz) give you a much richer sense of what happened in your experiment!

In this chapter, we will describe NHST, the conventional method that many students still learn (and many scientists still use) as their primary method for engaging with data. But we will also try to contextualize it as a very special case of a broader set of strategies around modeling and inference. Further, we will note how some of the pathologies of NHST have been a driver of the replication crisis.

What should replace NHST? There has been a recent move towards the use of Bayes Factors to quantify the evidence in support of a hypothesis. Bayes Factors can help answer questions like (2). We introduce these tools, and believe that they have broader applicability than the NHST framework and should be known by students. Both NHST and Bayes Factors are examples of what are called **inference** strategies, which are centered around drawing conclusions from data: significant or not, hypothesis one or hypothesis two.^[An important but subtle point is that "inference" is an ambiguous term. We are using it in the sense of drawing conclusions from data. But the term is used more broadly as well in the phrase "statisical inference," which is often contrasted with purely descriptive approaches. In this usage, "inference" means making generalizations from data that extend beyond the current set of observations. We do want to do that!]

We contrast inference strategies with **estimation** and **modeling** stratgies, which are more suited towards questions (3) and (4) [@krushke2018]. The goal of these strategies is to yield a precise estimate of the relationships underlying observed variation in the data. Critically, one of these estimates is the causal effect of the experimental manipulation(s). That explains our affection for these approaches: if a good theory predicts these kinds of causal effects, it makes sense that we'd want to estimate them precisely! Estimating one quantity in isolation is not maximally effective, though, since often there will be variation in the estimate that has to do with other known sources. If it's helpful to have an example, imagine the Stroop effect, which has a fairly consistent effect on both fast and slow readers [@haaf2017]. But estimates of this effect will be more precise if we take into account that some readers are slower or faster, rather than just averaging across all this variation.]

This isn't a statistics book and we won't attempt to teach the full array of important statistical concepts that will allow students to build good models of a broad array of datasets. (Sorry!).^[If you're interested in going deeper, here are two books that have been really influential for us. The first is @gelman2006, which teaches regression and multi-level modeling from the persepective of data description and modeling. The second is @mcelreath2018. a course on building Bayesian models of the causal structure of your data. Honestly, neither is an easy book to sit down and read (unless you are the kind of person who reads stats books on the subway for fun) but both really reward detailed study. We encourage you to get together a reading group and go through the exercises together. It'll be well worth while in its impact on your statistical and scientific thinking.] Instead, we're going to focus on the case wherethere is a single binary manipulation (experimental vs. control) and we want to estimate its effect



We'll start by looking at a case study that established modern statistical inference. Then we'll try to break this down by establishing t

üî¨ Case study: The lady tasting tea

The birth of modern statistical inference came from a single, epochal act of mansplaining.^[An important piece of context for the work of Ronald Fisher, Karl Pearson, and other early pioneers of statistical inference is that they were all strong proponents of eugenics. Fisher was the founding Chairman of the Cambridge Eugenics Society. Pearson was perhaps even worse, an avowed social darwinist who believed fervently in Eugenic legislation. These views are repugnant.] Sir Ronald Fisher was apparently at a party when a lady declared that she could tell the difference between cups when the tea was added to the milk vs. the milk to the tea. Rather than taking her at her word, Fisher devised an experimental and data analysis procedure to test her claim.^[If you're interested in this history, we recommend @salzburg2001's delightful book, "The Lady Tasting Tea" about the origins of modern statistics.]

The basic schema of the experiment was that the lady would have to judge a set of new cups of tea (a two-alternative forced choice measure). Her data would then be analyzed to determine whether her level of correct choice exceeded that expected by chance. While this process now sounds like a quotidian experiment that might be done on a cooking reality show, in fact this is one of those touchstones that feels unremarkable because it literally established the way science was done for the next century. 

The first element of the experiment that was unusual was its treatment of design confounds such as pouring order or cup material. Prior experimental practice would have been to assume that the best practice would have been to try to equate all of the cups as closely as possible, decreasing the influence of confounders. Fisher recognized that this strategy was insufficient and that random assignment was critical for making strong causal inferences about the treatment (milk then tea vs. tea then milk).^[We just asserted the causal power of random assignment in Chapter \@ref(intro) but here's where it originates!]

The second innovation was the idea of creating a model of what might happen during the experiment: specifically, a **null model** in which the nameless lady chose cups by chance rather than because of some tea sensitivity. The goal of the experiment was then to compute the probability of the lady's choices under this null model. Fisher computed the combinatorics of the situation and determined that correct classification of 

```{r}
dbinom(x = 8, size = 8, prob = .5)
```

For example, if she completed 8 tea-tasting trials, 

The lady tasting tea experiment:
Ronald Fisher at a party
Intuitive hypotheses: chance vs. tea knowledge.

Discussion question: What do we want to get out of this experiment? 
Binary conclusion: context of decision theory? 
Estimation of lady‚Äôs sensitivity for individual differences?

Back to the lady.

Discussion question: How many cups should she get right out of 12? 

What should we consider:
Too low a standard means we are ‚Äúliberal‚Äù ‚Äì the lady could get lucky
Too high a standard means we need the lady to know a lot!

Define decision-theoretic framework:

```{r}
# Truth of the hypothesis
# 
# 
# 
# 
# TRUE
# FALSE
# Test outcome
# FALSE
# False negative (MISS)
# True negative
# (Correct Rejection)
# TRUE
# False positive 
# (False Alarm)
# True positive
# (HIT)
```





Intuitive solution to the lady tasting tea: given the binomial distribution, how likely is her answer by chance? 
Excursion: what‚Äôs a probability distribution? A mathematical form to the idea of randomness of a particular type.

If she gets 6, clearly consistent with chance.
If she gets 7, 19% of exactly 7. 
But what‚Äôs the probability we care about? 7 OR MORE = 38%
If she gets 8 or more, 19% probability
9 or more, 7% - ARE YOU CONVINCED? 
10 or more, 2%

Oh and - how many cups of tea should we taste? 
Discussion goal: it depends on how strong we think her tea-tasting sense is!


This is a question about our goals, in particular 
:::

## Probability theory (also known as Bayes)

Bringing back prior knowledge question: how about ESP? 
Question: should we as scientists apply such a prior? 


Harry potter example

p(h | d) = [p(d | h) p(h)] / [p(d | h) p(h) + p(d | h‚Äô) p(h‚Äô)]   

p(h) = .001

p(d | h) = 1

p(h‚Äô) = .999

p(d | h‚Äô) = .0000001

So turn the crank to figure out whether Harry‚Äôs a wizard or no. 



Bayesian approaches provide one alternative
Philosophical alternative where probability indexes subjective belief, rather than long-run estimates of probability

We want the probability of the hypothesis given the data.

p(h | d) = p(d | h1) p(h1)
	p(d | h1) p(h1) + p(d | h0) p(h0)

P-values only give us the probability of the data given the hypothesis. 

So if H1 is very unlikely, low p-value still doesn‚Äôt mean we should change our belief. 

ESP example (Wagenmakers et al. 2011):
Assume p(h1) is 10x-20:

 
P < .05 provides almost no evidence!

So you need to apply the priors to get the kind of inferences you want. 



## Frequentist inference



Philosophy
Bayes: Data are the data, what can we infer? (subjective)
Frequentist: Do the same thing again and again, what happens (objective truth)
Prior information
Bayes theorem
‚ÄúData fixed‚Äù vs. ‚Äúmodel fixed‚Äù

Bayesians don‚Äôt have to care about optional stopping

Differences in philosophy
Bayesian stats are good for:
Cases where you have a lot of prior knowledge
E.g., statistics for voter prediction in elections
Cases where you want to deal with uncertainty in a principled way
E.g., integrating knowledge about measurement error into your model
Null models
Cases where you want to decide in favor of null
(though you can do this in frequentist perspectives)
Small N data
Many frequentist tests are based on guarantees in the limit. Guarantees don‚Äôt hold at N=3 or 5 or even 10. 
Frequentist good for:
Decision theory (cf. bayesian decision theory)
Absence of assumptions (‚Äúmore objective‚Äù)
Often easier to state and solve models

P-value misconceptions

Despite all these reasons to be worried about p-values, for many practicing scientists (at least at time of writing) there is no right answer. Even if we'd like to be Bayesian all the time because the paradigm makes philosophical and practical sense, there are a number of obstacles. First, though tools like `Stan`, `BayesFactor`, and `brms` make fitting Bayesian models easier (more about this below and in the next chapter), it's still on average quite a bit harder to fit a Bayesian model than it is a frequentist one. Second, because Bayesian analyses are less familiar, it may be an uphill battle to convince advisors, reviewers, and funders to use them. So as a group, we are still mostly Bayesian when we can be -- and frequentist when it's not practical. One reason we don't feel so bad about this stance is that, a lot of them time we're not so worried about making binary inferences, whether they are at $p < .05$ or $BF > 3$ or whatever the threshold is. 

## Making models: Inference vs estimation

Throughout this book we've taken the position that the goal of experiments is to estimate a causal effect of interest, ideally as part of some theory of how different constructs relate to one another. All this talk of hypotheses and inferences above is only indirectly related to that goal. 





- Intuition builder: For very large n, or flat prior, Bayes and frequentist coincide. 


### Simple models of between-group differences

Introducing simple inference models:

- The chi-squared test for inferring whether two samples come from the same distribution
- The t-test for inferring whether a single group‚Äôs effect differs from 0
- The t-test for inferring whether two groups differ from one another
- The paired t-test as a first glimpse at how we might account for participant-level random effects (see Chapter 7).


::: {.accident-report}
‚ö†Ô∏è Accident report: Once you have the basic t-test under your belt, it might feel natural to compare each group to 0 and conclude that one group is different from 0 and the other one isn‚Äôt. But ‚Äúthe difference between significant and not significant is not necessarily itself statistically significant‚Äù (Nieuwenhuis, Forstmann, and Wagenmakers 2011).

How to go from theory to hypotheses to statistical model


# Effect size

With all our talk about estimation above, we didn't say nuch about what precisely was being estimated. 

Effect size: a common language for describing group differences. Pros and cons of this approach. Pro: comparability across studies. Con: loss of information about measures and real-world predictions; dependence on baseline variability. 

Effect sizes (ES):
Cohen‚Äôs = m1 - m2 / SD
Units of ES easy to compare across studies
Good for comparison 
Example: school interventions to improve achievement
Necessary for meta-analysis
Example: MA of infant consonant discrimination (cross method comparison)
Necessary for power analysis 
Negative: not related to any real units
Many measures of ES, e.g. r2, n2 (eta), log odds

Precision

Error bar:
 - standard deviation (why is this bad)?
- SEM
- CI

CIs for inference

Confidence intervals:
95% of these regions will contain the TRUE parameter
	Remember frequentists - there is a TRUE parameter

https://istats.shinyapps.io/ExploreCoverage/

But this is not our typical interpretation, which is that 95% chance parameter is in this interval
	That‚Äôs the BAYESIAN interpretation

Bayesian Estimation

Find the posterior distribution of the parameter of interest
	You can take its mean
	Its HPD (highest posterior density)
